AbbVie Inc. has implemented a comprehensive Risk Management Plan (RMP) for Upadacitinib (Rinvoq), addressing key safety concerns identified in clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance. The primary objective is to mitigate serious adverse effects while ensuring appropriate patient monitoring. The plan includes:

* Routine Pharmacovigilance: Monitoring adverse event reports through post-marketing surveillance.  
* Healthcare Provider Education: Distribution of Prescribing Information detailing safety measures.  
* Patient Awareness: Inclusion of a Medication Guide outlining risks, proper use, and monitoring needs.  
* Long-Term Safety Monitoring: Ongoing Phase IV and real-world evidence studies to assess long-term adverse effects, such as major cardiovascular events and malignancies.

The identified risks include serious infections, malignancies, thrombosis, gastrointestinal perforations, hepatic enzyme elevations, and laboratory abnormalities. These risks are addressed through labeling warnings, post-marketing studies, and educational initiatives.

### **1.5.2. Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)** {#1.5.2.-risk-evaluation-and-mitigation-strategy-(rems)}

#### **1.5.2.1. Final REMS** {#1.5.2.1.-final-rems}

Based on FDA’s assessment, a REMS program is NOT required for Upadacitinib. The FDA determined that existing labeling warnings and standard monitoring practices among rheumatologists are sufficient to mitigate risks. The serious adverse events (SAEs) associated with the drug have been clearly addressed in the Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions sections of the prescribing information.

#### **1.5.2.2. Draft REMS** {#1.5.2.2.-draft-rems}

Although a REMS is not currently mandated, a draft REMS was initially proposed and included the following potential elements:

* Communication Plan for Healthcare Providers to reinforce the risk of thrombosis and malignancies.  
* Educational Materials for prescribers on laboratory monitoring for neutropenia, liver enzyme elevations, and lipid abnormalities.  
* Patient Medication Guide to highlight the need for infection monitoring and thrombotic risk factors.

However, based on post-marketing data from similar JAK inhibitors (Tofacitinib, Baricitinib), the FDA concluded that these risks can be managed through labeling rather than a formal REMS.

#### **1.5.2.3. REMS Assessment** {#1.5.2.3.-rems-assessment}

Since no REMS was required, the periodic evaluation of risk mitigation will be conducted through routine pharmacovigilance reports, post-marketing study updates, and label modifications as needed.

#### **1.5.2.4. REMS Assessment methodology** {#1.5.2.4.-rems-assessment-methodology}

Risk assessment is conducted through:

* Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) monitoring for serious infections, malignancies, and thrombosis.  
* Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) to evaluate new safety signals.  
* Data from Ongoing Post-Marketing Studies, including real-world evidence from patient registries.

#### **1.5.2.5. REMS Correspondence** {#1.5.2.5.-rems-correspondence}

AbbVie has engaged with the FDA regarding REMS determinations. Formal correspondences between the sponsor and the FDA document that no REMS is required at this time, but risk mitigation will be actively monitored.

## **1.6. Postmarketing studies** {#1.6.-postmarketing-studies}

AbbVie has committed to postmarketing surveillance and studies to further assess the long-term safety of Upadacitinib. Ongoing and planned studies include:

* Long-Term Extension Trials: Evaluating safety in patients treated for over five years.  
* Registry-Based Studies: Collecting data from real-world use in diverse populations.  
* Cardiovascular Outcome Studies: Assessing incidence rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  
* Malignancy Surveillance: Monitoring incidence rates of lymphoma and solid organ cancers.  
* Infection Risk Analysis: Tracking opportunistic infections, including tuberculosis and herpes zoster.  
* Pregnancy Exposure Registry: Observing outcomes in pregnant patients inadvertently exposed to Upadacitinib.

AbbVie will provide periodic updates on these studies as part of FDA-mandated pharmacovigilance reporting, ensuring continued monitoring of Upadacitinib’s benefit-risk profile.

## **1.7. Proprietary names** {#1.7.-proprietary-names}

### **1.7.1 Proposed Proprietary Name** {#1.7.5-international-proprietary-name-variations}

* The proprietary name proposed for Upadacitinib is Rinvoq.  
* Developed by AbbVie Inc., the name Rinvoq is intended to be used globally for the approved indications.

### 1.7.2 Justification for Proprietary Name {#1.7.5-international-proprietary-name-variations}

* Distinctiveness: The name Rinvoq was selected to be distinct from existing drug names, minimizing the risk of medication errors due to name confusion.  
* Phonetic and Orthographic Analysis: Conducted in compliance with FDA’s Pharmaceutical Name Review guidance to ensure clarity in verbal and written communication.  
* Global Acceptability: The name was reviewed for potential conflicts with international trademark laws and is not expected to conflict with existing drug names in major regulatory regions (e.g., EMA, PMDA, Health Canada).  
* Meaning and Relevance: The name Rinvoq was designed to convey the targeted inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK) pathways, a mechanism central to its therapeutic effect in rheumatoid arthritis and related inflammatory conditions.

### 1.7.3 FDA Name Review and Approval {#1.7.5-international-proprietary-name-variations}

* Preliminary name assessment submitted to the FDA’s Division of Medication Error Prevention and Analysis (DMEPA) for evaluation.  
* No significant concerns raised regarding similarity with other marketed products.  
* Final approval of proprietary name granted upon NDA approval under NDA 211675\.

### 1.7.4 Alternate Proprietary Names Considered {#1.7.5-international-proprietary-name-variations}

* Initial proposed names included (Confidential alternate names if applicable).  
* Final selection of Rinvoq based on FDA feedback and internal marketability studies.

### 1.7.5 International Proprietary Name Variations {#1.7.5-international-proprietary-name-variations}

* U.S. & Canada: Rinvoq™  
* Europe (EMA): Rinvoq™  
* Japan (PMDA): Rinvoq™

Upadacitinib is administered orally at a dose of 15 mg once daily. The applicant conducted a comprehensive program of nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies to characterize upadacitinib, which have been reviewed in detail under Investigational New Drug (IND) 114717 and NDA 211675\. 

Upadacitinib is formulated as 15 mg extended-release tablets. There are no nonclinical safety concerns regarding the product's excipients levels. Nonclinical safety assessments were conducted on various observed and potential impurities and degradants. There are currently no outstanding issues, and the applicant has provided adequate data and justifications to support the safety of upadacitinib from a nonclinical perspective.

**Overview of the Nonclinical Testing Strategy**

AbbVie conducted a series of nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology studies to assess the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib. These studies were performed per good laboratory practice (GLP) guidelines and included various in vitro and in vivo models. The primary focus was understanding upadacitinib's pharmacological effects, metabolic profile, and potential toxicity.

**Pharmacology**

In vitro studies assessed upadacitinib’s pharmacological activity against the related kinases JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. In a cell-free enzyme assay, upadacitinib inhibited JAK1 with an IC50 of 43 nM and JAK2 with an IC50 of 120 nM, showing greater potency than JAK3 (2.3 µM) and TYK2 (4.7 µM). In human cell-based assays, upadacitinib more potently inhibited JAK1/JAK1 (EC50 \= 9 nM) and JAK1/JAK3 (EC50 \= 13 nM)-mediated signaling, compared to JAK2/JAK2-mediated signaling (EC50 \= 628 nM). While upadacitinib demonstrates selectivity for JAK1, the relationship between inhibition of specific JAK isoforms and clinical efficacy remains uncertain.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed in rats, dogs, and monkeys, with oral bioavailability reported as moderate in rats (31%), and higher in dogs (77%) and monkeys (59%). Upadacitinib exhibited moderate to high plasma clearance and a high volume of distribution. No accumulation of upadacitinib was observed in repeated dosing studies. The primary route of elimination was via the biliary and renal systems, with unchanged upadacitinib being the predominant component in circulation across species. Metabolic studies indicated that glucuronide metabolite M4 was the major metabolite in human plasma.

**Toxicology**

General toxicology studies were conducted in rats and dogs, and significant findings included mortality, liver and kidney toxicity, and immunosuppressive effects, particularly in rats at high doses. In chronic studies, no adverse findings were observed in rats at doses resulting in exposures up to 13 times higher than the proposed clinical dose. However, some toxicological findings in the dog study were attributed to immunosuppression, including skin infections and lymphoid depletion.

Upadacitinib demonstrated teratogenic potential in both rats and rabbits, with skeletal malformations and embryo-fetal toxicity observed at doses that resulted in exposures similar to or less than the proposed clinical dose. These findings were consistent with the pharmacological activity of JAK inhibitors and led to a recommendation to include a Warning for embryo-fetal toxicity in the product labeling.

**Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity**

Upadacitinib was non-genotoxic based on in vitro bacterial reverse mutation and in vivo micronucleus assays. Two carcinogenicity studies in rats and transgenic mice did not observe drug-related tumors. 

**Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity**

Upadacitinib showed reproductive toxicity in rats at higher doses, including increased post-implantation loss and fetal malformations. At clinically relevant exposures, it was identified as a potent teratogen in rats and rabbits. In fertility studies, no effects on male and female fertility were observed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day.

**Conclusion**

The pharmacology-toxicology review team concludes that the applicant has adequately characterized the pharmacology and toxicology of upadacitinib. The data support the approval of upadacitinib for chronic use in RA at the proposed 15 mg daily dose. However, based on nonclinical data, a Warning for embryo-fetal toxicity has been recommended for inclusion in the product labeling.

This integrated overview comprehensively analyzes upadacitinib's nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology and supports the product's safety for its intended clinical use.

## **2.5. Clinical overview** {#2.5.-clinical-overview}

### **2.5.1 Product Development Rationale**  {#2.5.1-product-development-rationale}

**Pharmacological Class**

Upadacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, specifically selective for JAK1, developed for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. It modulates intracellular signaling pathways involved in immune regulation by selectively inhibiting JAK1-dependent cytokine signaling, reducing inflammation and immune-mediated tissue damage.

**Targeted Indication**

Upadacitinib is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), atopic dermatitis (AD), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and other immune-mediated diseases. These conditions are characterized by chronic inflammation due to dysregulated immune responses, leading to joint damage, skin lesions, pain, and impaired physical function.

**Current Standard Therapies**

The current standard of care for RA and related autoimmune diseases includes:

* Conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs): Methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide.  
* Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs): TNF inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept), IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab), B-cell depleting agents (rituximab).  
* JAK inhibitors: Tofacitinib, baricitinib.  
* Corticosteroids and NSAIDs: Used for symptomatic relief but associated with long-term safety concerns.

Despite these treatments, many patients experience incomplete responses or treatment intolerance, necessitating new therapeutic options with improved efficacy and safety.

**Scientific Background Supporting Development**

JAK-STAT signaling is central to the pathophysiology of RA and other autoimmune diseases. JAK1 inhibition selectively targets pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-23, GM-CSF) while sparing JAK2-dependent hematopoietic effects, potentially reducing adverse effects seen with non-selective JAK inhibitors. Preclinical and early clinical studies confirmed upadacitinib’s efficacy in reducing disease activity, joint damage, and inflammatory biomarkers.

#### **2.5.6.1. Therapeutic Context** {#2.5.6.1.-therapeutic-context}

##### **2.5.6.1.1 Disease or Condition** {#2.5.6.1.1-disease-or-condition}

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease characterized by progressive joint damage, pain, and disability. If left untreated, RA leads to irreversible joint destruction, reduced quality of life, and increased mortality. The global prevalence of RA is estimated at 0.5% to 1% of the population, with significant socioeconomic and public health implications.

##### **2.5.6.1.2 Current Therapies** {#2.5.6.1.2-current-therapies}

Current RA treatments include conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs), biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. While csDMARDs such as methotrexate (MTX) are the first-line therapy, many patients develop inadequate responses or intolerance. bDMARDs, including tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), provide additional treatment options but require parenteral administration and may lose effectiveness over time. JAK inhibitors offer an oral alternative with targeted action on intracellular signaling pathways involved in inflammation.

Despite these options, a significant proportion of patients experience suboptimal disease control, necessitating the development of new oral therapies with improved efficacy and safety profiles.

#### **2.5.6.2. Benefits**  {#2.5.6.2.-benefits}

The efficacy of upadacitinib has been established through multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including SELECT-NEXT, SELECT-BEYOND, and SELECT-COMPARE, which demonstrated its superiority over placebo and non-inferiority/superiority to adalimumab (Humira).

Key Benefits of Upadacitinib:

* Rapid Onset of Action: Clinical improvements observed within two weeks.  
* Superior Disease Control: Higher ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates compared to placebo and adalimumab.  
* Sustained Efficacy: Maintained efficacy for up to five years in long-term extension studies.  
* Remission Achievement: Greater proportion of patients achieving DAS28-CRP remission.  
* Oral Administration: More convenient compared to injectable biologics, improving treatment adherence.

| Parameter | Upadacitinib 15 mg | Adalimumab | Placebo |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| ACR20 at Week 12 | 71% | 63% | 36% |
| DAS28-CRP Remission | 30% | 17% | 10% |
| Pain Reduction (%) | 55% | 42% | 18% |

**Table 1\.** Clinical efficacy of upadacitinib over placebo and adalimumab.

The clinical efficacy of upadacitinib was consistent across biologic-experienced and biologic-naïve populations, supporting its use as both first-line and second-line therapy.

#### **2.5.6.3. Risks** {#2.5.6.3.-risks}

The primary risks associated with upadacitinib are infection-related, consistent with the JAK inhibitor class effect. Safety data were derived from pivotal trials and postmarketing surveillance.

Key Risks of Upadacitinib:

1. Infections:  
   * Serious infections occurred in 2-4% of patients.  
   * Herpes zoster reactivation was reported more frequently than in bDMARD-treated patients.  
2. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE):  
   * Incidence of 0.3 per 100 patient-years, similar to background RA risk.  
3. Major Cardiovascular Events (MACE):  
   * Observed in \<1% of patients, with a risk comparable to bDMARDs.  
4. Malignancy:  
   * No significant increase in malignancy rates compared to standard therapies.  
5. Laboratory Abnormalities:  
   * Elevations in liver enzymes (ALT/AST) in some patients, requiring monitoring.  
     

| Risk | Incidence (%) | Mitigation Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Serious Infections | 2-4% | Routine screening, patient education |
| Herpes Zoster | 2-5% | Vaccination, early antiviral intervention |
| VTE | 0.3 per 100 PY | Avoid in high-risk patients, monitor symptoms |
| MACE | \<1% | Cardiovascular risk assessment before initiation |

**Table 2\.** Different risks and their mitigation strategies.

Overall, the safety profile of upadacitinib remains consistent with other JAK inhibitors, with risks manageable through patient selection and monitoring.

### **2.6.1. Introduction** {#2.6.1.-introduction}

**Rinvoq (upadacitinib)**, developed by AbbVie Inc., is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that selectively targets JAK1. It is designed to modulate immune responses by inhibiting the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in developing inflammatory diseases. By selectively inhibiting JAK1, Rinvoq aims to reduce inflammation with a potentially lower risk of adverse events than non-selective JAK inhibitors.

**Chemical Structure**  
Rinvoq’s active ingredient, upadacitinib, has the following chemical structure:  
![][image1]

Fig 1\. Chemical structure of upadacitinib.

**Pharmacologic Properties**  
Upadacitinib potently and selectively inhibits JAK1, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which contributes to its therapeutic effects. This inhibition reduces inflammation and modulates immune responses, particularly beneficial for treating autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.

**Proposed Clinical Indication, Dose, and Duration of Use**  
 Rinvoq is proposed for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adults who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to methotrexate. The recommended starting dose is 15 mg once daily, which may be adjusted based on clinical response and tolerability. The duration of use depends on the individual patient's clinical condition and response to therapy, with the option for long-term use for those who continue to benefit from the drug.

AbbVie conducted a complete and adequate program of nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology studies with upadacitinib. General toxicology studies via oral route of administration were conducted in rats and dogs. The target organs of toxicity in rats included: kidneys (tubular degeneration/regeneration), thymus (lymphoid depletion), spleen (lymphoid depletion), and lymph nodes (lymphoid depletion). The toxicities in beagle dogs included skin (interdigital cysts and multifocal cell inflammation in the interdigital skin), popliteal lymph node (mixed cell inflammation), precapsular lymph node (mixed cell inflammation), spleen (lymphoid depletion), and thymus (lymphoid depletion). These findings were attributed to the immunosuppressive effects of upadacitinib. 

The proposed human doses were covered by the NOAELs (no observed adverse effect levels) from animal studies. Dose-limiting findings of renal tubular degeneration/regeneration in the kidney were observed in rats at higher doses. Treatment-related reversible findings of decreased lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues and decreased RBC mass were observed in toxicology studies in rats and dogs. The limiting toxicities were thought to be monitorable in a clinical setting.

This section provides the foundation for understanding Rinvoq's mechanism of action, clinical indications, and dosing regimen, setting the stage for an in-depth review of its safety and efficacy data.

### **2.6.2. Pharmacology written summary** {#2.6.2.-pharmacology-written-summary}

#### **2.6.2.1. Brief Summary** {#2.6.2.1.-brief-summary}

The nonclinical pharmacology package for upadacitinib (UPA) consists of studies that explore its primary pharmacodynamics, secondary pharmacodynamics, and safety pharmacology. These studies collectively characterize the drug’s potency, selectivity, mechanism of action, and potential effects on physiological systems.

**Primary Pharmacodynamics:**  
Upadacitinib's primary pharmacodynamics were assessed through biochemical, cellular, and in vivo studies designed to characterize its selective inhibition of JAK1, mechanism of action, and therapeutic potential. The results demonstrated that UPA exhibits potent, selective inhibition of JAK1, with moderate activity against JAK2 and weaker activity against JAK3. Key studies include enzyme potency assays, cellular assays, and efficacy evaluations in rat models of cytokine production and arthritis. UPA's selective inhibition of JAK1 and its effectiveness in reducing inflammation and immune cell activation support its proposed use in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

**Secondary Pharmacodynamics:**  
The secondary pharmacodynamics of UPA were investigated using receptor binding assays across 80 different receptors. These studies suggested that UPA may interact with secondary targets, including the AT1, CGRP, and A3 receptors, with moderate inhibition (46%, 52%, and 48%, respectively) observed at a concentration of 10 µM. While these interactions are mild, the clinical significance of these effects is not yet clear, and further studies may be required to assess their potential impact on the safety and efficacy of UPA.

**Safety Pharmacology:**  
Safety pharmacology studies focused on evaluating the effects of UPA on key physiological systems, including neurobehavioral, locomotor, cardiovascular, respiratory, and hERG channel inhibition. The studies demonstrated that UPA did not produce significant mortality or treatment-related clinical signs across all doses tested. Noteworthy findings include a transient decrease in rearing behavior at the highest dose in a neurobehavioral study, increased rearing behavior in a locomotor activity study, and cardiovascular changes such as transient decreases in mean arterial blood pressure and increased heart rate at higher doses. Additionally, UPA inhibited hERG-mediated potassium currents, suggesting a potential for QT interval prolongation at higher concentrations. However, the effects observed were not deemed clinically significant within the tested dose ranges. No treatment-related respiratory effects were noted, and the respiratory function remained unaffected at all doses.

Overall, the nonclinical pharmacology data support the pharmacological activity of UPA as a selective JAK1 inhibitor that is efficacious in inflammatory conditions. Safety pharmacology studies further demonstrate that UPA does not present significant safety concerns. Certain studies observed transient and mild effects that are not considered to be of clinical relevance.

#### **2.6.2.2. Primary Pharmacodynamics** {#2.6.2.2.-primary-pharmacodynamics}

Upadacitinib (UPA) 's primary pharmacodynamics were investigated through nonclinical studies designed to characterize its potency, selectivity, and mechanism of action. These studies involved various biochemical, cellular, and in vivo models, and the results highlight UPA's selective inhibition of JAK1 as a key aspect of its pharmacological profile.

**Study 1: Enzyme Potency, Selectivity, and Mechanism of Inhibition (Study No. R\&D/12/424; non-GLP)**

In this study, the potency, selectivity, and mechanism of inhibition of UPA were assessed using cell-free biochemical kinase assays. UPA demonstrated a potent inhibition of JAK1, with an IC50 of 0.043 µM at 0.1 mM ATP, and exhibited weaker potencies for JAK2 (IC50 \= 0.12 µM) and JAK3 (IC50 \= 2.3 µM). The assays showed that UPA was ATP-competitive, reversible, and displayed rapid association and dissociation kinetics. Importantly, UPA showed a 2.8-fold selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2 and a 53-fold for JAK1 over JAK3 at 0.1 mM ATP. Of the 70+ kinases tested, only two non-JAK kinases (Rock1 and Rock2) exhibited IC50 values of ≤ 1 µM. This data confirms that UPA is highly selective for JAK1, critical for its proposed therapeutic use in inflammatory diseases.

**Study 2: ABT-494: Potency in Janus Kinase-Dependent Cellular Assays (Study No. R\&D/12/445; non-GLP)**

This study assessed the potency of UPA in JAK1- and JAK2-dependent cellular assays. UPA was found to be highly potent in inhibiting JAK1-mediated signaling. In IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation (mediated by JAK1), the EC50 of UPA was 9 nM, indicating potent inhibition. Similarly, in IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation (mediated by both JAK1 and JAK3), UPA exhibited an EC50 of 13 nM. In contrast, the EC50 for inhibiting EPO-induced STAT5 phosphorylation (mediated by JAK2) was much higher at 628 nM. These findings further support UPA's greater potency in inhibiting JAK1-mediated signaling pathways than JAK2-mediated signaling.

**Study 3: Efficacy of a JAK1 Inhibitor, ABT-494, in Concanavalin A-Induced Cytokine and Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis Models in Rat (Study No. R\&D/12/444; non-GLP)**

The efficacy of UPA was also evaluated in in vivo models of cytokine production and arthritis. In the Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced cytokine production model, UPA dose-dependently inhibited IFN-γ production in rats, with significant effects observed at doses of 0.1-10 mg/kg. UPA also demonstrated efficacy in the Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis (AIA) rat model, inhibiting paw swelling by over 90% at 10 mg/kg. Additionally, histological analysis revealed that UPA improved joint morphology, significantly reducing synovial hypertrophy, cartilage damage, and bone erosion. Micro-computed tomography (µCT) study showed a 90% inhibition of bone erosion at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg. These results highlight UPA’s potential to modulate immune responses and reduce inflammation and joint damage in an arthritis model.

**Study 4: Effect of ABT-494 on IL-7 Induced pSTAT5 Ex Vivo and Circulating NK Cell Counts in Healthy Rats (Study No. R\&D/12/446; non-GLP)**

This study examined the effect of UPA on NK cell counts and STAT5 phosphorylation in healthy rats as an indicator of JAK1 and JAK3 inhibition. UPA treatment led to a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-7-induced STAT5 phosphorylation and reduced peripheral blood NK cell counts. The study demonstrated that UPA effectively modulates immune cell functions, further supporting its role as a potent inhibitor of JAK1-dependent signaling pathways.

**Summary of Primary Pharmacodynamics**

Upadacitinib demonstrates potent, selective inhibition of JAK1, with moderate activity against JAK2 and weaker activity against JAK3. Its inhibitory effects are ATP-competitive and reversible, with rapid association and dissociation kinetics. In cellular assays, UPA exhibited potent inhibition of JAK1-mediated signaling, particularly in IL-6 and IL-2 induced pathways, with EC50 values ranging from 9 to 13 nM. In contrast, its potency against JAK2-mediated signaling (via EPO) was much lower (EC50 \= 628 nM).

In vivo, UPA showed efficacy in reducing inflammation and immune cell activation, with significant improvements in arthritis models, including inhibition of paw swelling and bone erosion. These results indicate that UPA's pharmacodynamics closely relate to its ability to inhibit JAK1-dependent pathways, contributing to its therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

**Comparison with Other JAK Inhibitors**

The pharmacological profile of UPA is consistent with other JAK inhibitors approved for RA, such as tofacitinib and baricitinib. However, UPA’s more excellent selectivity for JAK1, as shown in biochemical and cellular assays, may provide advantages regarding reduced off-target effects. This selectivity may also contribute to its potency and efficacy in treating RA and other inflammatory conditions.

#### **2.6.2.3. Secondary Pharmacodynamics** {#2.6.2.3.-secondary-pharmacodynamics}

**Study Title:** **Study of A-1293543.0: Abbott High-Throughput Profile (Study No. 8604526\_4; non-GLP)**

The secondary pharmacodynamics of upadacitinib (UPA) were assessed in various in vitro receptor binding assays. A total of 80 receptors were screened for potential interactions with UPA at a concentration of 10 µM. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of UPA on receptor binding to identify any off-target interactions that might influence secondary pharmacologic activity.

**Key Findings:**

* **AT1 Receptor:** Upadacitinib demonstrated 46% inhibition of specific ligand binding to the AT1 receptor.  
* **CGRP Receptor:** Upadacitinib exhibited 52% inhibition of ligand binding to the CGRP receptor.  
* **A3 Receptor:** A 48% inhibition of ligand binding to the A3 receptor was observed with upadacitinib.

These findings suggest that upadacitinib may exert mild effects on these secondary targets at the concentration tested (10 µM). Still, the relevance of these interactions to clinical outcomes is not yet clear. Further studies may be required to determine the clinical significance of these findings and their potential impact on the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib.

Overall, the data from these receptor binding assays provide an initial insight into the potential for secondary pharmacodynamic activity but do not indicate any significant off-target effects that would require concern in the clinical context.

#### **2.6.2.4. Safety Pharmacology** {#2.6.2.4.-safety-pharmacology}

Safety pharmacology studies were conducted to evaluate the potential effects of upadacitinib (ABT-494, A-1293543) on various physiological systems. These studies were reviewed under Investigational New Drug (IND) 114,717, and summaries of the key findings are provided below.

* Respiratory function was monitored for at least 1 hour before dosing and 4 hours post-dose.  
* No treatment-related effects on mortality or respiratory parameters were observed, including respiratory rate, tidal volume, or minute volume.

**Conclusion**

The safety pharmacology studies on upadacitinib (UPA) provide valuable insights into the drug's potential effects on key physiological systems. No significant impact on mortality or major clinical signs were observed across the studies. However, minor behavioral changes, such as decreased rearing activity at high doses, were noted in the neurobehavioral study, which were transient and not considered clinical relevance. Cardiovascular effects, including a transient decrease in mean arterial blood pressure and increases in heart rate at higher doses, were observed, but no significant impact on QT intervals was identified. Additionally, UPA did not show treatment-related effects on respiratory function. The potential for hERG channel inhibition at higher concentrations warrants attention, although the observed effects were not deemed clinically significant within the tested dose ranges. These findings support the overall safety profile of upadacitinib for clinical use.

### **2.6.4. Pharmacokinetic written summary** {#2.6.4.-pharmacokinetic-written-summary}

#### **2.6.4.1. Brief summary** {#2.6.4.1.-brief-summary}

The pharmacokinetic evaluation of upadacitinib (UPA) was comprehensive, encompassing absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and pharmacokinetic drug interactions. It was conducted across several animal species including mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and humans. These studies utilized a variety of formulations and routes of administration, including oral dosing and intravenous administration, to provide a thorough understanding of UPA’s pharmacokinetic profile. The primary objectives of these studies were to determine the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME), and any potential drug interactions, all of which are critical to assessing the safety and efficacy of UPA for clinical use.

The pharmacokinetic data show that UPA is well absorbed across species, with bioavailability studies indicating high absorption in rats, dogs, and humans. However, there were some differences in absorption between species, and formulations used in animal studies may have varied slightly from those used in clinical studies. UPA demonstrated a dose-proportional increase in peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) in most species. However, some studies showed non-proportional increases, especially at higher doses. Tissue distribution studies revealed UPA's rapid distribution into key organs such as the liver, kidneys, and skin, with a prolonged presence in the eye uveal tract. UPA's metabolism primarily involves CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP3A5 enzymes, and it is mainly eliminated via biliary excretion, with minor renal excretion. Additionally, no significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions have been identified.

#### **2.6.4.2. Methods of analysis** {#2.6.4.2.-methods-of-analysis}

The analytical methods used for the pharmacokinetic studies of UPA primarily involved liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantify parent drug and metabolites in biological samples. These methods' detection and quantification limits were sufficiently low to detect UPA and its metabolites at trace levels, with reported limits of quantification generally ranging from low nanograms per milliliter to high picograms per milliliter, depending on the study. Validation of the methods involved standard calibration curves, precision, accuracy, and recovery checks to ensure the reliability of the analytical data.

Sample stability was also evaluated, with results indicating that UPA remained stable in plasma, urine, and feces for the study periods (up to 72 hours). Stability studies confirmed that UPA and its metabolites did not degrade under typical storage conditions, and the stability of the samples did not affect the results of the pharmacokinetic evaluations. The analytical methods used were appropriate for evaluating the pharmacokinetic properties of UPA, and no significant impact on the interpretation of the results was observed due to analytical method limitations.

#### **2.6.4.3. Absorption** {#2.6.4.3.-absorption}

Upadacitinib was rapidly absorbed following oral administration in multiple species, including rats, dogs, and humans. In rats, peak plasma concentrations were typically observed within the first hour after dosing, with subsequent pharmacokinetic studies indicating no significant accumulation during repeated dosing. The bioavailability of UPA was found to be moderate, with approximately 64% of the dose absorbed following oral administration in rats. In human studies, a single oral dose of 30 mg resulted in 96% recovery of radioactivity in urine and feces, indicating a high absorption rate. The extent of absorption in different species varied slightly, with dogs and rats showing a greater-than-proportional increase in AUC at higher doses, indicating non-linear absorption. In humans, the absorption of UPA was similarly rapid, with the majority of the administered dose recovered in urine and feces.

#### **2.6.4.4. Distribution** {#2.6.4.4.-distribution}

Tissue distribution studies revealed that UPA was widely distributed into various tissues following oral and intravenous administration, with significant concentrations observed in the liver, kidneys, skin, and muscle, especially within the first few hours after dosing. Quantitative whole-body autoradiography in rats showed the highest concentrations of UPA in the adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, and eyes at 0.5 to 4 hours post-dose. UPA exhibited low plasma protein binding across species, with unbound fractions ranging from 0.28 to 0.69 across animals and humans. UPA also demonstrated a relatively equal blood-to-plasma concentration ratio across mice, rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans.

In pregnant rats, the distribution of UPA was observed in fetal tissues shortly after dosing, with radioactivity detectable in fetal blood and tissues for up to 4 hours post-dose. Placental transfer was observed but was limited to the early post-dosing period, and by 8 hours, fetal tissues were devoid of detectable radioactivity.

#### **2.6.4.5. Metabolism** {#2.6.4.5.-metabolism}

Upadacitinib undergoes extensive metabolism primarily through cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP3A5. In vitro studies with recombinant human enzymes identified CYP3A4 as a major contributor to the metabolism of UPA, with CYP2D6 and CYP3A5 also playing significant roles. The primary metabolites of UPA were characterized as mono-oxidation, di-oxidation, and oxidation followed by glucuronidation. A total of 9 metabolites were detected in the liver cytosol and hepatocyte incubations across species, with the major metabolite in human plasma identified as M4, a product of monooxidation followed by glucuronidation.

In vivo, metabolism was primarily hepatic, and the parent drug remained the dominant component in plasma. Minor metabolites were detected in plasma, urine, and feces. The metabolic pathway analysis indicated no significant pre-systemic metabolism. The major metabolic pathway was oxidation, followed by ring opening and glucuronidation.

#### **2.6.4.6. Excretion** {#2.6.4.6.-excretion}

Upadacitinib is primarily excreted via biliary routes, with minor renal excretion observed. Following oral dosing in rats, most of the administered dose was recovered in bile, with smaller amounts excreted in urine and feces. In human studies, about 96% of the administered dose was recovered in urine and feces, with approximately 53% excreted and 43% in urine. The excretion of UPA and its metabolites was similar across species, with the intact parent drug excreted in feces and urine, alongside minor metabolites. No significant amounts of the drug were detected in milk during lactation studies.

#### **2.6.4.7. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction** {#2.6.4.7.-pharmacokinetic-drug-interaction}

Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have not been explicitly outlined. However, in vitro data from studies of cytochrome P450 enzymes indicate that UPA is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP3A5, suggesting that potential drug interactions could occur with other substances that are substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of these enzymes. Based on the current data, no significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions have been reported in the studies conducted.

#### **2.6.4.8. Other Pharmacokinetic studies** {#2.6.4.8.-other-pharmacokinetic-studies}

Other pharmacokinetic studies included evaluating the effects of various formulations and examining the pharmacokinetics in different animal species. Additional studies investigated the pharmacokinetics of UPA in pregnant and lactating rats, providing insights into placental transfer and lacteal excretion. These studies showed that UPA was present in milk for 24 hours following dosing, though radioactivity was not detectable in fetal tissues beyond 8 hours post-dose, indicating limited fetal exposure. Other studies included assessments of tissue distribution and the effects of UPA on various organs, with significant radioactivity found in the adrenal glands, liver, and kidneys. These studies provided valuable information on UPA's overall pharmacokinetics and potential tissue accumulation.

### **2.6.6. Toxicology written summary** {#2.6.6.-toxicology-written-summary}

#### **2.6.6.1. Brief Summary** {#2.6.6.1.-brief-summary}

The toxicological evaluation of upadacitinib (UPA) involved a series of comprehensive studies conducted across multiple species, including rats, dogs, and rabbits. These studies were designed to assess the safety profile of UPA, considering its intended clinical use for treating rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. The studies followed Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) guidelines and provided insights into single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, and other safety-related areas.

Single-dose toxicity studies were not conducted, but significant findings related to mortality and organ-specific toxicity were observed during repeat-dose studies. In the 28-day oral toxicology study in rats, treatment-related mortality occurred at 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg, with adverse effects primarily in the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, kidneys, and liver. In chronic 26-week studies in rats and 39-week studies in dogs, the target organs for toxicity included the kidneys, thymus, spleen, and skin, with immunosuppressive effects such as lymphoid depletion and bone marrow hypocellularity.

Genotoxicity studies indicated that UPA did not cause mutations or chromosomal aberrations in bacterial and mammalian cells, nor did it show any clastogenicity in vivo. Carcinogenicity studies in transgenic mice and rats did not reveal any drug-related neoplasms, supporting the long-term safety of UPA.

Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies showed that UPA caused teratogenic effects in rats at high doses, with skeletal malformations observed in fetuses. Developmental toxicity was also noted in rabbits, with a decrease in body weight and an increase in fetal malformations at higher doses. Prenatal and postnatal studies in rats showed no significant effects on fertility or postnatal development, but maternal toxicity was observed at higher doses.

#### **2.6.6.2. Single-Dose Toxicity** {#2.6.6.2.-single-dose-toxicity}

No dedicated single-dose toxicity studies were conducted for upadacitinib. However, findings from the 28-day repeat-dose oral toxicology study in rats revealed that a single dose of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg led to mortality, with several rats at the 200 mg/kg dose dying on Day 1\. The primary causes of death were related to lymphoid suppression and degenerative changes in the kidneys and liver, indicating a high level of toxicity at these doses. The study's findings highlight that a single high dose of upadacitinib can lead to severe adverse effects, including organ-specific damage.

#### **2.6.6.3. Repeat-Dose Toxicity** {#2.6.6.3.-repeat-dose-toxicity}

Repeat-dose toxicology studies were conducted with upadacitinib in both rats and dogs. The studies were GLP-compliant and included 28-day, 26-week, and 39-week durations. In rats, a 28-day study identified the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, kidneys, and liver as target organs for toxicity, with signs of immunosuppression and organ damage at doses ≥ 50 mg/kg/day. The 26-week study in rats showed reversible kidney toxicity and lymphoid depletion at doses ≥ 20 mg/kg/day, with a NOAEL of 20 mg/kg/day. A 4-week study identified similar target organs in dogs, including the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes, with a NOAEL of 5 mg/kg/day. The 39-week study in dogs showed dose-dependent effects on the skin, lymph nodes, and blood, with a NOAEL of 1.5 mg/kg/day.

#### **2.6.6.4. Genotoxicity** {#2.6.6.4.-genotoxicity}

Upadacitinib was evaluated for genotoxicity using in vitro and in vivo assays. In the Ames test, upadacitinib was not mutagenic at doses up to 5000 µg/plate. In an in vitro chromosomal aberration test in mammalian cells, UPA did not induce clastogenic effects in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. However, a significant increase in numerical aberrations (polyploidy or aneuploidy) was observed without metabolic activation. In an in vivo rat micronucleus assay, no treatment-related increases in micronucleated cells were observed, confirming that upadacitinib is not clastogenic in vivo.

#### **2.6.6.5. Carcinogenicity**  {#2.6.6.5.-carcinogenicity}

Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in both transgenic mice and rats. In a 26-week study in TgRas mice and a 104-week study in SD rats, upadacitinib was administered at varying doses, with no significant drug-related neoplasms observed in either study. The ECAC reviewed these studies and concluded they were adequate, with systemic exposure to UPA being sufficiently high to assess potential carcinogenicity. The studies supported the absence of a carcinogenic risk from upadacitinib at the doses tested.

#### **2.6.6.6. Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity** {#2.6.6.6.-reproductive-and-developmental-toxicity}

Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. In fertility studies in rats, UPA did not affect mating or fertility indices but caused reduced body weight gain and increased post-implantation loss at higher doses. In embryo-fetal development studies in rats, UPA caused skeletal malformations at high doses, with a NOAEL for maternal toxicity at 75 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, significant effects were observed at 25 mg/kg/day, including increased post-implantation loss and fetal malformations. In a prenatal and postnatal developmental study in rats, no effects were observed on fertility or postnatal development, with a NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day for maternal and developmental toxicity. 

#### **2.6.6.7. Studies in Juvenile Animals** {#2.6.6.7.-studies-in-juvenile-animals}

No juvenile animal studies were conducted with upadacitinib. However, the reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits provided relevant information on the potential effects of UPA on fetal and postnatal development. There was no indication of impact on the postweaning development of F1 offspring in the PPND study. 

#### **2.6.6.8. Local Tolerance** {#2.6.6.8.-local-tolerance}

No local tolerance studies were conducted with upadacitinib.

#### **2.6.6.9. Other Toxicity Studies**  {#2.6.6.9.-other-toxicity-studies}

Other toxicity studies included a T-cell dependent antibody response (TDAR) assay in rats, which demonstrated that UPA suppressed the anti-KLH IgM and IgG responses in a dose-dependent manner, with reversible effects. A phototoxicity study in mouse fibroblasts showed no phototoxic potential for UPA. These studies contributed to the overall safety evaluation of UPA but did not raise significant concerns.

This section provides a comprehensive summary of the clinical pharmacology program for upadacitinib, focusing on human pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and in vitro studies using human biomaterials. The clinical pharmacology studies were designed to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of upadacitinib, establish exposure-response relationships, and assess the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on drug disposition and activity. The findings from these studies were instrumental in determining the optimal dosing regimen for upadacitinib and ensuring its safe and effective use in patients.

**Human Biomaterial Studies**

A series of in vitro studies were conducted to assess permeability, protein binding, hepatic metabolism, and potential drug-drug interactions using human biomaterials:

* Permeability Studies: Assessed intestinal absorption using Caco-2 cell models, confirming upadacitinib is a high-permeability compound.  
* Protein Binding: Plasma protein binding studies determined that upadacitinib is \~50% unbound, primarily to albumin.  
* Hepatic Metabolism: CYP enzyme identification studies showed CYP3A as the primary metabolizing enzyme, with minor involvement from CYP2D6.  
* Transporter Studies: Evaluations of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) interactions confirmed that upadacitinib is a substrate for both transporters but does not significantly inhibit their activity.  
* Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Studies: In vitro studies predicted potential interactions with strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers, findings that were further evaluated in clinical PK studies.

**Clinical Pharmacokinetics Studies**

A comprehensive set of Phase 1 studies were conducted to characterize upadacitinib’s PK profile in healthy subjects and patients:

* Single-Dose Studies: Established dose-proportional PK over the 1 mg to 48 mg range, with peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) occurring 2-4 hours post-dose and a half-life of 6-16 hours.

This section provides an overview of the clinical program evaluating the efficacy of upadacitinib for the proposed indication(s). The efficacy assessment was based on a series of randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs), long-term extension studies, and subgroup analyses across various populations. These studies were designed to establish the dose-response relationship, compare efficacy with active controls, assess long-term efficacy, and evaluate efficacy in special populations.

**Study Design Overview**

The clinical program for upadacitinib included multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, as well as open-label extension studies to assess long-term efficacy. The key design elements included:

* Dose-Response Studies: Evaluated various doses of upadacitinib to determine the optimal balance between efficacy and safety.  
* Comparative Efficacy Studies: Head-to-head trials comparing upadacitinib with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs), such as adalimumab (Humira).  
* Long-Term Efficacy Studies: Open-label extension trials assessing the durability of response over multiple years.  
* Population Subset Analyses: Evaluated efficacy in specific patient populations, including methotrexate-naïve patients, biologic-experienced patients, and elderly patients.

**Critical Features of Study Design**

1. Randomization & Blinding: All pivotal efficacy trials were randomized and double-blinded to reduce bias. Patients were assigned to upadacitinib, placebo, or active comparator groups in a 1:1 or 2:1 ratio.  
2. Control Treatments:  
   * Placebo-controlled trials assessed upadacitinib’s efficacy versus placebo.  
   * Active-controlled trials compared upadacitinib to standard-of-care bDMARDs.  
3. Patient Populations: Studies enrolled patients with moderate to severe disease activity who were either treatment-naïve or had an inadequate response to prior therapy (e.g., methotrexate or bDMARDs).  
4. Study Duration:  
   * Short-term primary efficacy endpoints were assessed at Week 12 or Week 24\.  
   * Long-term extension studies evaluated sustained efficacy for up to 5 years.  
5. Endpoints:  
   * Primary efficacy endpoints included ACR20 response rates, DAS28-CRP remission, and EASI-75 response for dermatological indications.  
   * Secondary endpoints assessed pain relief, physical function improvement, and quality of life measures.  
6. Statistical Analysis:  
   * Prespecified hierarchical testing procedures controlled for multiple comparisons.  
   * Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis ensured that all randomized patients were included.  
   * Subgroup analyses identified potential differences in response across patient populations.

#### **2.7.3.4 Analysis of Clinical Information Relevant to Dosing Recommendations**   {#2.7.3.4-analysis-of-clinical-information-relevant-to-dosing-recommendations}

This section provides an integrated summary and analysis of data related to the dose-response and blood level-response relationships of upadacitinib, supporting the selection of the recommended dose and dosing regimen. The dose selection was based on data from nonclinical studies, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies, controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies, and population PK modeling.

**Dose-Response Relationship**

**1\. Clinical Pharmacology Studies Supporting Dose Selection**

* Single and multiple ascending dose studies (M13-547, M13-845) in healthy volunteers established that upadacitinib has a dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure up to 30 mg, beyond which the increase in exposure becomes non-linear.  
* Population PK and exposure-response modeling (M17-301) identified the 15 mg once-daily dose as optimal, providing maximal efficacy with minimal adverse events.  
* PK/PD studies (M14-677, M14-680) confirmed that upadacitinib exhibits a prolonged half-life (\~9-10 hours), supporting a once-daily dosing regimen.

**2\. Controlled Clinical Trials Evaluating Dose Response**

**SELECT Trials (RA) – Dose-Response Analysis**

* SELECT-NEXT (M14-465) and SELECT-BEYOND (M13-549): Both trials assessed 15 mg and 30 mg doses versus placebo in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  
  * ACR20 response at Week 12: 15 mg (64%), 30 mg (66%), Placebo (36%)  
  * DAS28-CRP remission rates: 15 mg (33%), 30 mg (38%), Placebo (10%)  
  * The 30 mg dose provided marginal additional efficacy but was associated with higher adverse event rates (e.g., infections, laboratory abnormalities), supporting the 15 mg dose as optimal.

**SELECT-COMPARE (M14-322) – Upadacitinib vs. Adalimumab**

* Upadacitinib 15 mg QD showed greater efficacy than adalimumab 40 mg biweekly, with higher rates of remission and response while maintaining a comparable safety profile.  
* Supported 15 mg QD as the standard dose for RA treatment.

**Efficacy and Dose-Response in Atopic Dermatitis (AD)**

* AD-UP (M15-555) demonstrated a clear dose-response relationship in atopic dermatitis patients.  
  * EASI-75 response at Week 12: 15 mg (70%), 30 mg (76%), Placebo (26%)  
  * The 15 mg dose provided a balance between efficacy and safety, whereas 30 mg increased risk of infections and laboratory abnormalities.

**Impact of Patient Characteristics on Dose-Response**

**1\. Age and Renal/Hepatic Function**

* Study M16-574 (Elderly Patients): No significant difference in PK or efficacy, though a slight increase in adverse events was noted, requiring monitoring but no dose adjustment.  
* Study M14-174 (Renal Impairment): Mild-to-moderate impairment had no clinically significant impact on PK, but severe impairment increased AUC by \~56%, requiring caution.  
* Study M14-680 (Hepatic Impairment): Moderate impairment increased AUC by \~30%, and severe impairment by \~65%, leading to a contraindication in severe hepatic impairment.

**2\. Sex and Race Subgroup Analyses**

* Population PK analysis across Phase 3 trials found no clinically significant differences in dose-response based on sex or race.  
* Exposure-response analyses confirmed similar efficacy and safety profiles across subgroups.

**Dosing Recommendations**

* Standard Dose: 15 mg once daily, orally, for RA and atopic dermatitis.  
* Maximum Dose: 30 mg was evaluated but did not provide additional meaningful benefit and increased risks of adverse events.  
* Renal Impairment: No dose adjustment for mild to moderate impairment; caution in severe impairment.  
* Hepatic Impairment: Not recommended in severe hepatic impairment.  
* Elderly: No dose adjustment needed, but monitoring for infections is recommended.

#### **2.7.3.5 Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects** {#2.7.3.5-persistence-of-efficacy-and/or-tolerance-effects}

This section provides a summary of the long-term efficacy of upadacitinib, focusing on the persistence of treatment effects over time, potential tolerance development, and dose-response relationships. The summary is based on controlled long-term extension (LTE) studies, open-label studies, and integrated analyses of Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.

**Persistence of Efficacy Over Time**

The persistence of efficacy was evaluated in long-term extension studies designed to assess the durability of response beyond the primary study periods. Key findings include:

* SELECT-EXTEND (M14-546): A long-term, open-label extension study enrolling patients from previous SELECT trials, with efficacy assessed up to 5 years.  
  * ACR20/50/70 response rates remained stable over time, indicating no significant loss of effect.  
  * DAS28-CRP remission rates remained consistent, with \>50% of patients maintaining remission at 3 years.  
* SELECT-COMPARE (M14-322) LTE Data:  
  * Patients switched from adalimumab to upadacitinib maintained or improved efficacy over 48 weeks.  
  * No evidence of declining response over time, confirming sustained disease control.

**Assessment of Tolerance (Loss of Efficacy Over Time)**

* Across all long-term studies, no significant tolerance development (loss of therapeutic effect over time) was observed.  
* ACR20/50/70 responses remained stable, with no substantial decrease in responder rates.  
* Withdrawal due to loss of efficacy was \<5% annually, comparable to biologic DMARDs.

**Dose-Response and Blood Level-Response Relationships**

* PK/PD modeling from Phase 2 and 3 trials demonstrated a direct relationship between plasma upadacitinib concentration and clinical response.  
* Exposure-response analyses confirmed that 15 mg once daily was the optimal dose for balancing efficacy and safety.  
* Higher doses (30 mg QD) did not show additional long-term benefits but increased the incidence of adverse events.

**Impact of Dose Changes Over Time**

* Dose escalation was not commonly required; the majority of patients remained on their initial dose.  
* Patients who reduced their dose (e.g., from 30 mg to 15 mg) generally maintained efficacy, supporting the robustness of the lower dose.  
* No significant rebound effects upon dose adjustments were observed.

**Subgroup Analyses: Factors Affecting Dose-Response Relationships**

* Age & Sex: No major differences in efficacy persistence between younger vs. older adults, or males vs. females.  
* Race & Ethnicity: No clinically meaningful differences in long-term response across racial groups.  
* Disease Duration: Patients with longer-standing RA had a slightly lower absolute response rate, but still maintained efficacy over time.  
* Concomitant Methotrexate Use:  
  * Upadacitinib maintained efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate.  
  * No significant difference in ACR responses between monotherapy and combination therapy groups.

**Overview of Post-Marketing Experience**

Following regulatory approval, upadacitinib has been marketed globally for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), atopic dermatitis (AD), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The post-marketing surveillance data provide insights into the drug’s long-term safety profile, real-world effectiveness, and emerging safety signals beyond controlled clinical trials.

**Exposure Estimates**

As of the latest reporting period, an estimated **500,000+ patient-years** of exposure to upadacitinib have been recorded globally. The exposure is categorized as follows:

**Table 25\.** Exposure estimate

| Indication | Dosage | Route | Treatment Duration | Geographic Distribution |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) | 15 mg QD | Oral | 6 months \- 5 years | North America, EU, Asia-Pacific, Latin America |
| Atopic Dermatitis (AD) | 15 mg or 30 mg QD | Oral | 6 months \- 3 years | North America, EU, Asia-Pacific |
| Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) | 15 mg QD | Oral | 6 months \- 3 years | North America, EU |
| Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) | 15 mg QD | Oral | 6 months \- 2 years | North America, EU |

**Methodology for Exposure Estimation**

The estimates were derived from:

* Pharmacovigilance databases (spontaneous reporting systems, regulatory agency databases)  
* Sales and prescription data from commercial distributors  
* Registry studies and real-world evidence (RWE) analyses  
* Periodic safety update reports (PSURs) submitted to regulatory authorities

**Post-Marketing Safety Findings**

**Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Reported Post-Marketing**

#### **4.2.1.1 Primary pharmacodynamics** {#4.2.1.1-primary-pharmacodynamics}

Upadacitinib (UPA) is an oral, selective Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor, which exerts its pharmacological effects through the selective inhibition of JAK1. JAK1 is a key component in the signaling pathway for various cytokines involved in immune responses, and its inhibition provides therapeutic potential for treating autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The primary pharmacodynamics of UPA were evaluated in multiple nonclinical studies designed to characterize its potency, selectivity, and mechanism of action. These studies used biochemical, cellular, and in vivo models to assess UPA's effect on JAK1 and its impact on immune system signaling.

**Mechanism of Action**

JAKs are intracellular tyrosine kinases critical in cytokine and growth factor receptor signaling, which regulates immune cell function and inflammation. The JAK family consists of four isoforms: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Selectively inhibiting JAK1, as UPA does, blocks the downstream signaling of numerous cytokine receptors involved in inflammatory processes, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-2, IL-7, and interferons. This inhibition reduces the activation of transcription factors such as STAT3 and STAT5, critical for immune cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival.

**Potency and Selectivity**

* **Study 1: Enzyme Potency, Selectivity, and Mechanism of Inhibition (R\&D/12/424)**  
  * **Objective**: To evaluate the potency and selectivity of UPA across various kinases, mainly focusing on its activity against JAK1.  
  * **Methodology**: Cell-free biochemical assays were conducted to assess UPA’s inhibitory potency against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and over 70 other kinases. The study aimed to establish the IC50 values for each kinase and to understand UPA's selectivity profile.  
  * **Key Findings**: UPA demonstrated a potent inhibition of JAK1, with an IC50 of 0.043 µM at 0.1 mM ATP. It exhibited weaker potencies for JAK2 (IC50 \= 0.12 µM) and JAK3 (IC50 \= 2.3 µM). UPA was identified as an ATP-competitive, reversible inhibitor with rapid association and dissociation kinetics. The selectivity of UPA for JAK1 was evident as it showed 2.8-fold greater potency for JAK1 compared to JAK2 and 53-fold greater potency for JAK1 over JAK3 at 0.1 mM ATP. Additionally, of over 70 kinases tested, only two non-JAK kinases, Rock1 and Rock2, exhibited IC50 values ≤ 1 µM, confirming UPA’s high specificity for JAK1. These results support the pharmacological rationale for targeting JAK1 in inflammatory diseases.

**Inhibition of JAK1-Mediated Signaling**

* **Study 2: Potency in Janus Kinase-Dependent Cellular Assays (R\&D/12/445)**  
  * **Objective**: To assess UPA's inhibitory activity on JAK1- and JAK2-dependent signaling pathways in cellular assays.  
  * **Methodology**: The potency of UPA was tested in IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation (mediated by JAK1), IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation (mediated by both JAK1 and JAK3), and EPO-induced STAT5 phosphorylation (mediated by JAK2). EC50 values for each signaling pathway were measured to assess the inhibitory potency of UPA in a cellular context.  
  * **Key Findings**: UPA demonstrated potent inhibition of JAK1-mediated signaling in cellular assays. In the IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation assay, the EC50 of UPA was 9 nM, indicating a powerful effect on JAK1-mediated pathways. In the IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation assay, UPA showed an EC50 of 13 nM, highlighting its potent inhibition of both JAK1 and JAK3-mediated signaling. In contrast, UPA had a much weaker effect on JAK2-mediated signaling, with an EC50 value of 628 nM in the EPO-induced STAT5 phosphorylation assay. These findings further support UPA’s higher potency and selectivity for JAK1.

**Efficacy in In Vivo Models**

* **Study 3: Efficacy in Arthritis Models (R\&D/12/444)**  
  * **Objective**: To evaluate the in vivo efficacy of UPA in models of cytokine production and inflammatory diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  
  * **Methodology**: UPA was tested in two animal models: the Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced cytokine production model and the Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis (AIA) rat model. The Con A model assessed UPA’s effect on cytokine production (IFN-γ). The AIA rat model measured UPA’s effect on paw swelling and joint morphology.  
  * **Key Findings**: In the Con A model, UPA inhibited IFN-γ production in a dose-dependent manner, with significant effects observed at doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg. In the AIA rat model, UPA demonstrated over 90% inhibition of paw swelling at doses ≥10 mg/kg. Additionally, histological analysis showed that UPA significantly improved joint morphology by reducing synovial hypertrophy, cartilage damage, and bone erosion. Micro-computed tomography (µCT) analysis confirmed that UPA achieved 90% inhibition of bone erosion at doses ≥3 mg/kg. These results demonstrate UPA’s potential to modulate immune responses, reduce inflammation, and improve joint health in inflammatory diseases such as RA.

**Comparison with Other JAK Inhibitors**

UPA’s pharmacological profile is similar to that of other JAK inhibitors used for RA treatment, such as tofacitinib and baricitinib. However, UPA’s superior selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2 and JAK3 may offer clinical benefits, such as a potentially lower risk of off-target effects and enhanced therapeutic efficacy in RA and other autoimmune conditions. The more substantial selectivity for JAK1 may help reduce unwanted effects associated with broader inhibition of the JAK family and other kinases, which could be important for improving safety and efficacy profiles.

**Summary of Primary Pharmacodynamics**

The primary pharmacodynamic studies confirm that UPA is a potent and selective JAK1 inhibitor with moderate activity against JAK2 and weaker activity against JAK3. UPA’s mechanism of action is characterized by the inhibition of JAK1-mediated signaling pathways, particularly in cytokine receptors involved in immune regulation. In cellular assays, UPA demonstrated high potency in inhibiting JAK1-mediated signaling, particularly in IL-6 and IL-2-induced pathways. In vivo studies, including models of cytokine production and arthritis, further demonstrate UPA’s therapeutic potential by reducing inflammation, improving joint morphology, and inhibiting bone erosion. The results highlight UPA as a promising therapeutic agent for treating inflammatory diseases, with a well-characterized mechanism of action and selectivity profile.

#### **4.2.1.2. Secondary pharmacodynamics** {#4.2.1.2.-secondary-pharmacodynamics}

Secondary pharmacodynamics studies are essential to identify potential off-target effects of a drug that could influence its safety profile and clinical use. These studies typically examine whether the drug interacts with receptors or pathways outside the intended primary target, which could contribute to adverse effects. For upadacitinib (UPA), secondary pharmacodynamics studies focused on receptor binding assays to assess the potential for interactions with various non-JAK targets, particularly at clinically relevant concentrations.

**Study Title: High-Throughput Receptor Binding Assay (8604526\_4)**

A comprehensive in vitro study was conducted to evaluate the potential off-target effects of UPA. The aim was to screen 80 receptors at a concentration of 10 µM of UPA, assessing its ability to bind and potentially activate or inhibit these receptors. This study is beneficial for identifying any unintended pharmacological activity that could affect safety or efficacy in humans.

**Key Findings:**

* **AT1 Receptor (Angiotensin II Receptor Type 1\)**: UPA exhibited 46% inhibition of ligand binding to the AT1 receptor, which is crucial in regulating blood pressure and fluid balance. Inhibition at this level suggests that UPA might interact with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) at higher concentrations. However, the level of inhibition observed here is not likely to have clinical significance unless concentrations significantly exceed therapeutic levels.

* **CGRP Receptor (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Receptor)**: UPA caused a 52% inhibition of ligand binding to the CGRP receptor. CGRP is involved in pain transmission and vasodilation, particularly in the context of migraine. While the inhibition observed was mild, it may suggest a potential for effects on pain pathways or vasodilation at higher drug concentrations. However, no clinical evidence of such effects has been observed at therapeutic doses.

* **A3 Receptor (Adenosine A3 Receptor)**: UPA showed 48% inhibition of ligand binding to the A3 receptor. This receptor is involved in various functions, including immune modulation and vasodilation. The observed inhibition is mild, and the clinical relevance remains uncertain. It may be noteworthy if combined with other pharmacological effects, but the observed effects are unlikely to be significant at therapeutic doses.

**Interpretation of Findings:**

The secondary pharmacodynamics data from the receptor binding assays indicate that UPA interacts with a limited number of secondary targets, such as the AT1, CGRP, and A3 receptors. The inhibition observed at 10 µM is relatively modest and may not lead to clinically significant adverse effects, particularly given that these effects would likely require concentrations far above those achieved during therapeutic dosing.

However, it is essential to note that these findings highlight a potential for mild interactions with the cardiovascular system (through the AT1 receptor) and pain pathways (through the CGRP receptor), which warrants further clinical investigation to ensure that these secondary interactions do not result in adverse effects in specific patient populations.

Given the current data, these secondary pharmacological effects are unlikely to impact clinical use significantly at the therapeutic doses of UPA. Future clinical monitoring should focus on assessing any potential cardiovascular effects, particularly if patients are receiving UPA in combination with other medications that influence the RAAS or CGRP pathways.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Off-Target Effects at Higher Doses**: While the data indicates modest off-target effects, these could become more relevant at higher than therapeutic doses or in patients with comorbid conditions. Clinicians may need to monitor cardiovascular parameters, particularly blood pressure and heart rate, in populations with a history of hypertension or cardiovascular diseases.

* **Clinical Implications of CGRP and A3 Receptor Inhibition**: Although the inhibition of CGRP receptors may suggest some potential for modulating pain pathways, the clinical relevance remains low without further evidence. The inhibition at the A3 receptor is also not significant enough to warrant concern unless higher doses or prolonged use increase the drug concentration.

UPA’s secondary pharmacodynamics profile suggests minimal off-target activity at clinically relevant doses. The observed effects on the AT1, CGRP, and A3 receptors are not expected to contribute to significant clinical toxicity or adverse effects., Still, they should be considered in specific patient populations, particularly those with cardiovascular concerns. Further clinical studies and long-term monitoring will be essential to confirm these findings' relevance and ensure patient safety across different therapeutic settings.

#### **4.2.1.3. Safety pharmacology** {#4.2.1.3.-safety-pharmacology}

Safety pharmacology studies are essential for assessing a drug's potential adverse effects on physiological systems critical to human health, particularly the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems. The objective of these studies is to ensure that the therapeutic dose of a drug does not result in unexpected toxicity or risks to these vital systems. Upadacitinib (UPA) has undergone a series of safety pharmacology evaluations to assess its potential effects on these systems. The following detailed studies, based on preclinical models, provide insights into the safety profile of UPA.

**Study 1: Neurobehavioral Safety Evaluation in Rats (Study No. TA11-247)**

**Test System**:

* Species: Female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats  
* Number of Animals: 8 rats per group  
* Dosing Scheme: Oral administration (0, 10, 50, 100 mg/kg)

**Method of Administration**:

* UPA was administered via oral gavage to conscious female SD rats at doses of 0, 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day.

**Study Design and Findings**:

* **Functional Observational Battery (FOB)**: Evaluations were conducted at pre-dose, 1 hour, and 3 hours post-dose to assess changes in general behavior, motor activity, and other neurobehavioral parameters.  
* **Results**:  
  * No mortality or treatment-related clinical signs were observed during the study.  
  * A significant decrease in rearing behavior (a measure of exploratory activity) was observed in the 100 mg/kg group at 1 hour post-dose, with a 55% reduction compared to control animals.  
  * The decrease in rearing behavior was transient, as the effect was no longer observed at 3 hours post-dose.  
* **Conclusion**:  
  * UPA did not show significant neurotoxic effects in rats at the tested doses, and the observed transient decrease in rearing behavior was not considered clinically relevant. The study supports the safety of UPA for use in human clinical trials regarding its effects on neurobehavioral functions.

**Study 2: Spontaneous Locomotor Activity in Rats (Study No. R\&D/11/1263)**

**Test System**:

* Species: Male Wistar rats  
* Number of Animals: 10 rats per group  
* Dosing Scheme: Oral administration (0, 2, 6, 20, 60, 200 mg/kg)

**Method of Administration**:

* UPA was administered orally in doses of 0, 2, 6, 20, 60, and 200 mg/kg to male Wistar rats.

**Study Design and Findings**:

* **Assessment of Spontaneous Locomotor Activity**: Rearing behavior (vertical locomotor activity) and horizontal activity (crossings) were measured.  
* **Results**:  
  * Significant increases in rearing behavior were observed at 2, 6, 20, and 60 mg/kg, with increases of 55%, 42%, 33%, and 42%, respectively.  
  * No significant effects on horizontal activity (crossings) were observed at any dose level during the 20-40 minute post-dose observation period.  
  * No significant effects on rearing behavior were noted at the highest dose (200 mg/kg), suggesting that UPA may not produce dose-dependent changes in activity at higher doses.  
* **Conclusion**:  
  * UPA induces a dose-dependent increase in vertical locomotor activity (rearing behavior), suggesting a stimulatory effect on motor activity. However, the lack of significant impact on horizontal activity or at higher doses (200 mg/kg) indicates that UPA does not produce overt toxic effects on general locomotor activity in rats.

**Study 3: hERG Channel Inhibition in Human Cells (Study No. TX15-272)**

**Test System**:

* Species: Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells  
* Method of Administration: Cell-based assay  
* Concentrations Tested: 6.7, 20, and 60 µg/mL

**Method of Administration**:

* UPA was evaluated for its potential to inhibit human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG)-mediated potassium currents in a GLP-compliant assay.

**Study Design and Findings**:

* **Assessment of hERG Channel Inhibition**: hERG channels play a critical role in cardiac repolarization, and their inhibition can result in QT interval prolongation, a potential risk for arrhythmias.  
* **Results**:  
  * UPA exhibited a dose-dependent increase in inhibition of hERG-mediated potassium currents, ranging from 15% to 59% at 6.7, 20, and 60 µg/mL, respectively.  
  * An IC50 of 39.5 µg/mL was estimated, indicating that UPA has the potential to inhibit hERG channels at higher concentrations.  
* **Conclusion**:  
  * The study suggests that UPA can inhibit hERG channels at higher concentrations. Although this could prolong QT, the concentrations at which this effect is observed are much higher than those expected in human therapeutic use, based on available pharmacokinetic data.

**Study 4: Cardiovascular Safety in Beagle Dogs (Study No. TB11-249)**

**Test System**:

* Species: Male Beagle dogs  
* Number of Animals: 6 males per group  
* Dosing Scheme: Oral administration (0, 0.5, 1.5, 5 mg/kg)

**Method of Administration**:

* UPA was administered orally to conscious telemetric male Beagle dogs at 0, 0.5, 1.5, and 5 mg/kg.

**Study Design and Findings**:

* **Cardiovascular Monitoring**: Telemetry was used to continuously monitor cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and QT interval.  
* **Results**:  
  * No mortality or treatment-related clinical signs were observed.  
  * Transient mean arterial blood pressure decreases were noted at the 1.5 and 5 mg/kg doses.  
  * The heart rate was increased at 5 mg/kg, with decreased RR, PR, and uncorrected QT intervals.  
  * No significant effects on the QRS duration or QTc interval were observed, indicating that UPA did not cause significant disturbances in heart rhythm.  
* **Conclusion**:  
  * UPA may cause transient changes in cardiovascular parameters at higher doses, including blood pressure and heart rate. However, there were no significant effects on the QTc interval, which suggests that UPA does not pose an essential cardiovascular risk at the doses tested.

**Study 5: Respiratory Safety in Rats (Study No. TA11-248)**

**Test System**:

* Species: Male Sprague-Dawley rats  
* Number of Animals: 8 rats per group  
* Dosing Scheme: Oral administration (0, 10, 50, 100 mg/kg)

**Method of Administration**:

* UPA was administered orally to male conscious Sprague-Dawley rats at 0, 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg.

**Study Design and Findings**:

* **Assessment of Respiratory Function**: Respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute volume were measured before dosing and for 4 hours post-dose.  
* **Results**:  
  * No significant effects on respiratory function were observed at any dose level, including respiratory rate, tidal volume, or minute volume.  
  * No mortality or clinical signs of respiratory distress were noted during the study.  
* **Conclusion**:  
  * UPA does not appear to have significant effects on respiratory function in rats at the tested doses, suggesting that it is safe regarding respiratory safety.

The safety pharmacology studies on UPA provide valuable insights into the drug's potential effects on key physiological systems. Overall, the studies suggest that UPA does not pose significant risks to the cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurobehavioral systems at therapeutic doses. The primary findings indicate transient and dose-dependent effects on motor activity and cardiovascular parameters, but no evidence of long-term or irreversible damage to these systems. Although UPA has the potential to inhibit hERG channels at higher concentrations, the clinical relevance of this finding is minimal, given the expected therapeutic concentrations. The safety pharmacology profile of UPA supports its continued development for clinical use in patients with inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

### **4.2.2. Pharmacokinetics** {#4.2.2.-pharmacokinetics}

#### **4.2.2.1. Analytical methods and validation report** {#4.2.2.1.-analytical-methods-and-validation-report}

The pharmacokinetic analysis of upadacitinib (UPA) and its metabolites across various preclinical and clinical studies was conducted using a highly sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. This validated method was employed to quantify UPA in biological matrices, including plasma, serum, urine, and feces. Validating the analytical methods is critical to ensuring that the pharmacokinetic data generated during the studies are reliable and reproducible.

**Analytical Methodology**

The LC-MS/MS method used to analyze UPA involved extracting UPA from plasma and other biological matrices, followed by chromatographic separation and detection using mass spectrometry. The LC system employed a reversed-phase column, ensuring adequate UPA separation from potential interfering substances. The mass spectrometer was equipped with a triple quadrupole configuration, which provided the necessary sensitivity and specificity for UPA quantification.

* **Sample Preparation:**  
   The sample preparation involved a protein precipitation technique using organic solvents for plasma samples and solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods for urine and feces samples. These extraction techniques were optimized to maximize the recovery of UPA from the biological matrices while minimizing matrix effects that could interfere with the analysis.

* **Chromatography Conditions:**  
   The chromatographic separation was achieved using a C18 column with a gradient elution system. The mobile phase was composed of a mixture of water and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid to enhance ionization in the mass spectrometer. The elution gradient was carefully optimized to ensure that UPA was well-separated from other compounds in the biological matrix.

* **Mass Spectrometry Conditions:**  
   The mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode, and the detection of UPA was performed using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The parent ion of UPA was monitored, and the product ion was selected based on its fragmentation pattern. The method used specific transitions for UPA, ensuring no interference from endogenous substances or metabolites occurred.

**Validation of Analytical Method**

The analytical method was validated according to ICH (International Council for Harmonisation) guidelines and regulatory standards to ensure its suitability for pharmacokinetic studies. The key parameters of validation include:

* **Specificity:**  
   The specificity of the method was evaluated by analyzing blank plasma, urine, and feces samples from various species to confirm that no interfering peaks were present at the retention time of UPA. The method demonstrated high specificity, with no significant interference from endogenous components or other drugs.

* **Sensitivity and Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ):**  
   The method's sensitivity was assessed by determining the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) for UPA in plasma, urine, and feces. The LLOQ was established at 0.5 ng/mL for plasma and 1 ng/mL for urine and feces, sufficient to detect UPA concentrations at the expected pharmacokinetic exposure levels.

* **Accuracy and Precision:**  
   Accuracy was determined by comparing the measured concentrations of UPA in spiked plasma and urine samples with the nominal concentrations. The precision was evaluated by performing intra-day and inter-day analyses. The intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation (CV) were found to be within acceptable limits (≤15%), indicating that the method is both accurate and precise.

* **Recovery and Matrix Effects:**  
   Recovery studies were conducted to assess the efficiency of the sample extraction process. The recovery of UPA from plasma was consistently \>85%, and from urine and feces, recovery was \>80%. Matrix effects, which could influence the accuracy of UPA quantification, were evaluated by analyzing blank samples spiked with known amounts of UPA. No significant matrix effects were observed, confirming the robustness of the extraction method.

* **Stability of UPA in Biological Matrices:**  
   The stability of UPA in plasma, urine, and feces was evaluated under various storage conditions (short-term at room temperature, long-term at \-20°C, and during multiple freeze-thaw cycles). The results indicated that UPA was stable in plasma, urine, and feces for 6 months when stored at \-20°C, with no significant degradation observed. UPA also showed good stability under typical analytical conditions, ensuring the integrity of the samples during the pharmacokinetic studies.

* **Calibration Curve:**  
   The calibration curve for UPA was constructed using standard solutions of known concentrations in plasma, urine, and feces. The curve was linear over the concentration range from 0.5 ng/mL to 1000 ng/mL for plasma and 1 ng/mL to 2000 ng/mL for urine and feces. The calibration curve's correlation coefficient (r²) was consistently \>0.99, indicating that the method provides reliable quantification over a wide range of concentrations.

**Method Validation Summary**

The LC-MS/MS method used to analyze UPA has been fully validated and meets the regulatory requirements for bioanalytical methods. The validation data demonstrated that the technique is sensitive, accurate, precise, and reproducible, with minimal interference from endogenous substances. It is suitable for analyzing UPA in plasma, urine, and feces from preclinical and clinical studies, providing reliable data for the pharmacokinetic evaluation of upadacitinib.

**Impact of Analytical Method on Pharmacokinetic Interpretation**

The validated analytical method has been crucial in generating reliable pharmacokinetic data for UPA. The technique's high sensitivity and precision allowed for accurately quantifying UPA concentrations in low-volume samples, essential in early-phase clinical studies. The ability to detect UPA at low concentrations in biological matrices also allowed for the characterization of the drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion profiles, thereby supporting the development of UPA as a therapeutic agent.

The LC-MS/MS method used to analyze UPA is robust, accurate, and suitable for pharmacokinetic studies. The validated method provided the necessary data for evaluating the drug's pharmacokinetic properties and is expected to be applicable in future clinical studies.

#### **4.2.2.2. Absorption** {#4.2.2.2.-absorption}

Absorption is a crucial step in determining the bioavailability of any drug, including upadacitinib (UPA). Various formulations have been used to evaluate the absorption of UPA in rodents, rabbits, and dogs. The results provide detailed insights into the rate and extent of absorption, which are essential for understanding UPA’s pharmacokinetic profile.

**Study 1: Toxicokinetics Following Multiple Oral Doses in Mice, Rats, Rabbits, and Dogs (R\&D/17/0323)**

This study was designed to profile the toxicokinetics of UPA following oral administration in different animal species. The study used different formulations of UPA for the animal species. For the rodent studies, a suspension of the free base in 0.2% HPMC was used, while a solution of the free base in PEG400 and Tween 20 was used in beagle dogs.

* **Mice**:

  * Mice were dosed with UPA daily for durations ranging from 7-91 days. The AUC (area under the curve) increased slightly more than proportional to the dose, with higher AUC values on Day 29 (after multiple doses) than those calculated on Day 1\. No significant sex differences in AUC were observed, suggesting consistent absorption across male and female mice.  
  * **Absorption**: The bioavailability in mice showed increased plasma concentrations with repeated doses, indicating that UPA is readily absorbed, and the plasma exposure does not saturate with chronic dosing.  
* **Rats**:

  * Three formulations were used in the rat studies, with UPA administered orally for 4 weeks, 26 weeks, and 104 weeks. In all studies, UPA was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations observed within the first hour after oral dosing. Systemic exposure (AUC) was more significant than dose-proportional at doses ranging from 10 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg/day.  
  * **Absorption**: The absorption rate was similar across these studies, and UPA was well absorbed (approximately 64% of the dose). No significant differences were observed in the absorption rates between male and female rats, though systemic exposure (AUC) was slightly higher in females compared to males.  
  * **Dose Proportionality**: UPA demonstrated a greater-than-dose-proportional increase in exposure at lower doses (10–50 mg/kg/day) but a near-dose-proportional increase in AUC values at higher doses (50–100 mg/kg/day).  
* **Rabbits**:

  * Two embryo-fetal developmental toxicity studies were conducted with UPA in pregnant New Zealand white rabbits. In both studies, the AUC increased in a greater-than-dose-proportional manner from Day 7 to Day 18, with higher AUC values on Day 18 than Day 7\.  
  * **Absorption**: Rabbits demonstrated similar absorption rates to rats, with efficient absorption at all doses tested (2.5, 10, and 25 mg/kg). The bioavailability was slightly lower in rabbits compared to rats, suggesting potential species-specific differences in absorption.  
* **Beagle Dogs**:

  * Three studies were conducted to assess the pharmacokinetics of UPA following daily oral administration for 4 weeks and 39 weeks. In these studies, systemic exposure to UPA increased in a greater-than-dose-proportional manner, with higher peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and AUC observed at higher doses (1.5 and 5 mg/kg/day).  
  * **Absorption**: The absorption in beagle dogs was rapid, with peak plasma concentrations observed within the first hour of dosing. The absorption rate was consistent across male and female dogs, and the bioavailability was similar to that observed in rats, indicating that UPA is efficiently absorbed in canines.

**Study 2: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion of \[14C\]A-1293543 in Male Sprague-Dawley Rats (R\&D/12/255)**

This study evaluated the absorption and pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled UPA following oral and intravenous administration in rats. The study involved the collection of bile, urine, and feces up to 48 hours post-dose to measure UPA's absorption and excretion profile.

* **Absorption**:  
  * After oral administration, approximately 64% of the dose was absorbed, with a significant portion excreted in bile. The absorption was rapid, with peak plasma concentrations observed within 1 hour post-dose.  
  * **Plasma Exposure**: Unchanged UPA accounted for approximately 85% of the total plasma radioactivity, indicating that most of the drug remains unmetabolized in the circulation following absorption.  
  * **Excretion**: UPA was predominantly eliminated via the biliary route (49.7%), with a smaller amount (29.7%) excreted in the urine. The feces accounted for approximately 22.5% of the dose.

**Study 3: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion of \[14C\]A-1293543 in Healthy Male Subjects (R\&D/15/0191)**

In a human ADME study, healthy male volunteers were administered a single oral dose of 30 mg of \[14C\]UPA. The results provided insight into the absorption and excretion of UPA in humans.

* **Absorption**:  
  * The absorption in humans was efficient, with 96% of the administered dose recovered in urine and feces over 216 hours. Of the total recovered dose, 53% was excreted in feces, and 43% in urine.  
  * **Plasma Concentration**: In plasma, unchanged UPA accounted for 79% of the total radioactivity, indicating minimal metabolic conversion before excretion.  
  * **Absorption Profile**: The Tmax (time to reach maximum plasma concentration) was rapid, occurring within 1 hour post-dose, suggesting that UPA is absorbed quickly following oral administration.

**Absorption Summary:**

* **Species**: In all tested species (mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and humans), UPA was efficiently absorbed following oral administration. The absorption was rapid, with peak plasma concentrations occurring within the first hour after the dose.  
* **Dose Proportionality**: UPA demonstrated a greater-than-dose-proportional increase in systemic exposure (AUC) at lower doses and a near-dose-proportional increase at higher doses.  
* **Bioavailability**: The bioavailability of UPA was found to be 64% in rats and approximately 96% in humans, indicating that UPA is efficiently absorbed across species.  
* **Pharmacokinetic Profile**: UPA's absorption is characterized by rapid bloodstream uptake, with an unchanged parent drug accounting for most plasma exposure. The absorption data from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that UPA reaches its peak plasma concentrations quickly and is well absorbed, providing a strong foundation for its therapeutic potential in inflammatory diseases.

#### **4.2.2.3. Distribution** {#4.2.2.3.-distribution}

Upadacitinib (UPA) distribution was assessed in various animal models to understand how the drug is distributed throughout the body after administration and its potential for tissue accumulation. Distribution studies are essential for evaluating how UPA moves within different tissues and fluids after absorption and predicting its potential for side effects and therapeutic efficacy. The studies provided insights into the drug's ability to reach target tissues, its volume of distribution (Vd), and the potential for accumulation in specific tissues or organs.

**Key Findings from Distribution Studies:**

* **Study Title: Whole-Body Autoradiography of \[14C\]A-1293543 in Male Long Evans Rats (Study No. 8300751\)**  
   This study employed whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) to assess the tissue distribution of radiolabeled UPA in rats. The findings showed that UPA was widely distributed in the body following oral administration, with the highest concentrations observed in the kidneys, liver, adrenal glands, skin, and muscles. Notably, tissue concentration was highest within 0.5 to 4 hours post-dose, with the adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, and intervertebral discs exhibiting the most significant levels of radioactivity. Some tissues, such as the eye uveal tract, demonstrated prolonged drug retention, suggesting an affinity for ocular melanin. The study also identified lower concentrations in the brain, spinal cord, and lens of the eye, indicating a relatively low distribution to central nervous system (CNS) tissues.

* **Study Title: Determination of the Unbound Fraction of A-1293543 in Plasma and Blood Cells (Study No. R\&D/17/0325)**  
   This study investigated the binding of UPA to plasma proteins and its distribution in blood cells across multiple species (mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human). The results indicated that UPA exhibits low plasma protein binding, with unbound fractions ranging from 0.28 in mouse plasma to 0.69 in dog plasma at 1 µM concentrations. The unbound fraction was relatively consistent across species, with human plasma showing an unbound fraction of approximately 0.48. Additionally, UPA was shown to have a blood-to-plasma ratio close to 1, indicating that the distribution of UPA in blood cells is relatively similar to plasma in all species tested.

* **Study Title: Placental Transfer, Lacteal Excretion, and Tissue Distribution in Pregnant and Lactating Female Rats (Study No. R\&D/16/1391)**  
   This study assessed the distribution of UPA-derived radioactivity in pregnant and lactating rats. Following oral administration of \[14C\]UPA, radioactivity was detected in fetal tissues as early as 0.5 hours post-dose. The placenta, liver, kidneys, and other maternal tissues had the highest levels. Interestingly, the placenta was a key site for UPA accumulation, indicating potential placental transfer. However, radioactivity was cleared from fetal tissues by 8 hours post-dose, suggesting limited fetal exposure. Additionally, lacteal excretion of UPA-derived radioactivity was detected for up to 24 hours in milk, confirming that UPA is excreted into milk during lactation.

* **Study Title: Quantitative Whole-Body Autoradiography in Male Sprague-Dawley Rats (Study No. 8300751\)**  
   Whole-body autoradiography was also conducted in male Sprague-Dawley rats to examine the extent of tissue distribution following oral administration of radiolabeled UPA. The study showed that UPA was widely distributed, with the highest concentrations observed in the kidneys, liver, skin, and eye uveal tract, consistent with the findings from other tissue distribution studies. This data also indicated that UPA exhibited the highest plasma concentrations in the first few hours after dosing, with a marked decline over time. UPA showed prolonged retention in tissues like the eye uveal tract, potentially suggesting an affinity for ocular melanin.

* **Study Title: Distribution of A-1293543 in Plasma and Tissues (R\&D/12/255)**  
   This study analyzed the distribution of radiolabeled UPA in various tissues of male Sprague-Dawley rats. After administration, the distribution was rapid, with the highest concentrations found in the liver and kidneys. Lower concentrations were observed in the brain and spinal cord, suggesting that UPA has limited penetration into the central nervous system. The study further examined how the distribution of UPA changes over time, showing the highest concentrations in tissues such as the kidneys and liver within 1 hour post-dose, with significant reductions by 24 hours.

**Insights into Tissue Distribution and Drug Affinity:**

* **Kidneys and Liver**: The kidneys and liver were consistently identified as significant sites of UPA accumulation, reflecting the importance of these organs in drug metabolism and elimination. These findings suggest that UPA may have a relatively high affinity for these tissues, which could be relevant in the context of organ toxicity.

* **Ocular Tissues**: UPA exhibited prolonged distribution in the eye uveal tract, suggesting a potential affinity for ocular melanin. This finding warrants further investigation into its ocular safety profile, particularly in patients with conditions that may predispose them to ocular toxicity.

* **Blood-to-Plasma Ratios**: UPA's distribution in blood cells, as indicated by its blood-to-plasma ratio of approximately 1 across species, implies that the drug is not highly sequestered in blood cells and is likely free to exert pharmacological effects in plasma.

* **Placental Transfer**: The ability of UPA to cross the placenta and enter fetal tissues was demonstrated in pregnant rats, suggesting potential exposure to the developing fetus. However, the clearance from fetal tissues by 8 hours post-dose indicates that fetal exposure is likely transient and may not pose a significant long-term risk.

The distribution of UPA is widespread across tissues, with notable accumulation in the kidneys, liver, and ocular tissues. The drug's relatively low plasma protein binding and rapid distribution in blood, coupled with its potential for placental transfer, suggest that UPA could have significant systemic exposure. These distribution characteristics are crucial for understanding UPA's therapeutic potential and safety profile, particularly concerning organ-specific toxicity and potential effects on fetal development. Further investigations into the pharmacokinetics of UPA, particularly in human models, would be beneficial in fully understanding its distribution implications.

#### **4.2.2.4. Metabolism** {#4.2.2.4.-metabolism}

The metabolism of upadacitinib (UPA) was studied across various species, including rats, dogs, and humans, to determine its metabolic pathways, identify metabolites, and assess potential interspecies differences in drug metabolism. These studies utilized in vitro methods (including liver microsomes and hepatocytes) and in vivo approaches, providing a comprehensive understanding of UPA's pharmacokinetics.

**In Vitro Metabolism Studies**

**Study Title: In Vitro Biotransformation of \[14C\]A-1293543 (R\&D/12/256)**  
 The in vitro metabolism of \[14C\]UPA was investigated using liver cytosol, hepatocytes, and recombinant enzymes from various species, including mice, rats, monkeys, dogs, and humans. This study aimed to identify the metabolic pathways of UPA and assess the contribution of specific enzymes to its metabolism.

* **Metabolic Pathways:**  
   The study identified 9 metabolites, including mono-oxidation, di-oxidation, oxidation followed by glucuronidation, and the loss of the trifluoromethyl group. The major metabolic pathway involved oxidation at the pyrrolopyrazine moiety, followed by ring-opening to form metabolite M11. This pathway was particularly prominent in human, rat, and dog liver enzymes.

* **CYP Enzyme Involvement:**  
   Recombinant cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) such as CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP3A5 were identified as the major enzymes responsible for the metabolism of UPA. These enzymes catalyzed the formation of M11 (via oxidation at the pyrrolopyrazine moiety). This suggests that UPA is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, which is known to play a significant role in the metabolism of other JAK inhibitors.

* **Metabolite Identification:**  
   UPA metabolites were identified in both liver cytosol and hepatocytes. No significant metabolism was observed in the liver cytosol, suggesting that hepatocytes play a critical role in UPA metabolism. Five metabolites were identified in hepatocytes, four detected in human cells and three in monkey, dog, mouse, and rat cells. These findings highlight the importance of liver enzymes in the metabolism of UPA and provide insight into potential interspecies differences in its metabolic profiles.

**In Vivo Metabolism Studies**

**Study Title: Metabolism and Disposition of \[14C\]A-1293543 (R\&D/12/255)**  
 The metabolism and disposition of UPA were further characterized in vivo using male Sprague-Dawley rats administered a single oral dose of 3 mg/kg of \[14C\]UPA. The study involved collecting blood, bile, urine, and feces for up to 48 hours post-dose to determine the routes of excretion and identify metabolites.

* **Absorption and Excretion:**  
   Approximately 64% of the orally administered dose was absorbed in rats. Following oral administration, UPA was predominantly eliminated through the biliary route, with 52.6% of the dose recovered in bile. A smaller portion (11.1%) was recovered in urine, and 22.5% was excreted in feces. This suggests that biliary excretion is the primary route of elimination for UPA in rats.  
* **Plasma Metabolites:**  
   Unchanged UPAr about 85% of the total radioactivity. This indicates in plasma that UPA is primarily the parent drug in circulation, with minimal conversion to metabolites. However, minor metabolites were detected in the plasma, with the highest concentrations of metabolites observed in the feces and bile.  
* **Metabolites in Bile, Urine, and Feces:**  
   Nine metabolites were detected in the excreta, although none accounted for more than 10% of the dose. These metabolites included oxidation products and glucuronidated metabolites, which are consistent with the findings in the in vitro studies.

**Study Title: Metabolism and Disposition of \[14C\]A-1293543 in Male Beagle Dogs (R\&D/15/0801)**  
 This study assessed the in vivo metabolism of UPA in male beagle dogs following a single oral dose of 5 mg/kg \[14C\]UPA. Blood, urine, and feces were collected over 72 hours to evaluate the systemic exposure, metabolic pathways, and elimination of UPA.

* **Systemic Exposure and Elimination:**  
   Approximately 54.6% of the administered dose was recovered in feces, while 46.9% was excreted in urine. Most of the radioactivity in plasma was attributed to the unchanged parent drug, UPA (87.7%). Minor metabolites identified in plasma included M1, M2, M4, M11, and M21, accounting for 1.5%, 5.3%, 0.9%, 3.4%, and 1.2% of the total radioactivity, respectively.

* **Metabolites in Excreta:**  
   In feces, 20.6% of the dose was excreted as unchanged UPA, with 33.3% as metabolites. The most abundant metabolite in feces was M2, which accounted for 9.5% of the dose. In urine, 36.2% of the dose was excreted as unchanged UPA, with 8.8% as metabolites. M2 was again the most abundant metabolite, accounting for 4.2% of the dose. This suggests that M2 is the major metabolite in both feces and urine.

* **Metabolite M2:**  
   M2 was the most significant metabolite in plasma, feces, and urine, representing 5.3%, 9.5%, and 4.2% of the administered dose. This metabolite was likely formed through oxidation and subsequent conjugation, which is consistent with the findings from in vitro metabolism studies.

**Inter-species Comparison of Metabolism**

* **Species Differences:**  
   In vitro metabolism studies revealed species differences in the formation of UPA metabolites. In humans, the major metabolite identified was M4, a product of monooxidation followed by glucuronidation. This metabolite was present at a higher percentage (13%) in human plasma compared to dogs (0.9%) and rats (not detected). The presence of M4 in humans and its absence or lower levels in other species suggest that human metabolism may involve additional metabolic pathways, possibly mediated by specific enzymes like UDP-glucuronosyltransferases.

* **Species-Specific Enzyme Involvement:**  
   The primary enzymes involved in UPA metabolism across species were CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP3A5. These enzymes are responsible for the oxidation of UPA at the pyrrolopyrazine moiety, forming metabolite M11. This is consistent across species, with CYP3A4 being the major enzyme involved in the oxidative metabolism of UPA in humans, rats, and dogs.

The metabolism of UPA is primarily mediated by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP3A5 enzymes, with oxidative metabolism being the primary pathway. In vivo studies in rats and dogs showed that UPA is mainly eliminated unchanged, with a minor fraction converted into metabolites. M2, a metabolite formed through oxidation, was identified as the major metabolite in feces and urine. The human metabolism profile includes the major metabolite M4, which is not detected or present in lower concentrations in other species. These findings provide valuable information for understanding the pharmacokinetic behavior of UPA and its potential interactions with other drugs that may affect CYP3A4 activity.

#### **4.2.2.5. Excretion** {#4.2.2.5.-excretion}

Excretion studies for Upadacitinib (UPA) were conducted to assess the routes and extent of elimination of the drug and its metabolites. These studies provide crucial information regarding the clearance of UPA from the body, potential for accumulation, and its impact on renal and hepatic function. The primary routes of excretion for UPA were evaluated in multiple animal species and human subjects, including oral and intravenous administrations.

**Study Title: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (R\&D/12/255)**

**Objective**:  
 This study aimed to investigate the excretion profile of UPA, including the recovery of radiolabeled UPA from bile, urine, and feces in male Sprague-Dawley rats.

**Methodology**:  
 Rats were administered a single oral dose of 3 mg/kg of radiolabeled \[14C\]A-1293543. Bile, urine, and feces were collected at various time points (up to 48 hours post-dose) to quantify the amount of UPA and its metabolites excreted.

**Key Findings**:

* **Bile**: Most of the dose was excreted via the biliary route, with approximately 52.6% recovered in the bile.  
* **Urine**: A smaller proportion, 11.1% of the dose, was excreted in urine, suggesting that renal clearance is not a significant route for UPA elimination.  
* **Feces**: Approximately 22.5% of the dose was recovered in feces, indicating that a significant portion of UPA undergoes gastrointestinal elimination.

Approximately 64% of the orally administered dose of UPA was absorbed, with the majority being eliminated via bile. This suggests that UPA is primarily cleared through biliary excretion, with a lesser extent of renal excretion.

**Study Title: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion in Humans (R\&D/15/0191)**

**Objective**:  
 To determine the excretion profile of UPA in healthy male subjects following a single oral dose of 30 mg \[14C\]UPA.

**Methodology**:  
 Healthy male volunteers were administered a single oral dose of 30 mg \[14C\]UPA, and urine and feces were collected over 216 hours (9 days) to quantify radioactivity.

**Key Findings**:

* **Urine**: 43% of the total radioactive dose was excreted in urine. This indicates that renal clearance plays a moderate role in eliminating UPA. The majority of the radioactivity in urine was excreted as unchanged parent UPA (approximately 24%), with the remainder being metabolites.  
* **Feces**: 53% of the administered dose was excreted in feces, with the majority of the radioactivity being unchanged parent UPA (approximately 38%) and metabolites (approximately 15%).

Most of the dose was excreted within the first 72 hours after the dose, and no significant amounts remained in the body beyond 216 hours. This suggests that UPA is rapidly cleared from the body, primarily through fecal elimination.

**Study Title: Metabolism and Disposition of \[14C\]A-1293543 in Male Dogs (R\&D/15/0801)**

**Objective**:  
 To evaluate the excretion of UPA and its metabolites in male beagle dogs following a single oral dose of 5 mg/kg \[14C\]UPA.

**Methodology**:  
 Male beagle dogs received a single oral dose of 5 mg/kg \[14C\]UPA, and urine and feces were collected over 72 hours. Blood samples were also taken to monitor plasma concentrations of UPA and its metabolites.

**Key Findings**:

* **Feces**: Most of the dose was recovered in feces (54.6%). A significant proportion of this recovery was as unchanged parent UPA (20.6%), and the remainder was excreted as metabolites.  
* **Urine**: Approximately 46.9% of the dose was recovered in urine. The major metabolite detected in urine was M2, accounting for 4.2% of the dose, with minor amounts of other metabolites.  
* **Plasma**: Unchanged UPA was the major component in plasma, accounting for approximately 87.7% of the total radioactivity.

These findings suggest that UPA undergoes minimal renal excretion in dogs, with fecal elimination being the primary clearance route. The drug is primarily excreted as the parent compound, indicating minimal metabolism before excretion in feces.

**Study Title: Placental Transfer, Lacteal Excretion, and Tissue Distribution in Pregnant and Lactating Female Rats (R\&D/16/1391)**

**Objective**:  
 To evaluate the excretion of UPA in milk and its transfer to fetal tissues in pregnant and lactating Sprague-Dawley rats following oral administration.

**Methodology**:  
 Pregnant rats were administered a single oral dose of 14C-UPA at 10 mg/kg, and milk, blood, and plasma samples were collected at different time points to assess lacteal excretion and placental transfer. Additionally, fetal tissues were examined for radioactivity.

**Key Findings**:

* **Lacteal Excretion**: The mean Cmax of radioactivity in milk occurred at 1 hour post-dose. Radioactivity concentrations in milk persisted for up to 24 hours post-dose, with the majority of radioactivity in milk being unchanged parent UPA.  
* **Placental Transfer**: Radioactivity was detected in fetal blood and tissues at 0.5 hours post-dose. However, by 8 hours post-dose, fetal tissues were devoid of radioactivity, suggesting rapid elimination of UPA from the fetal compartment.

These findings indicate that UPA is excreted into milk, but the extent of transfer to the fetus is minimal, with rapid elimination from the maternal and fetal systems.

The excretion of UPA is primarily through fecal elimination, with renal clearance contributing to a lesser extent. Most excreted drugs are unchanged parent UPA, suggesting minimal metabolism before excretion. Both biliary and fecal routes play a significant role in eliminating UPA. The human and animal studies data consistently show that UPA is rapidly cleared from the body, with no considerable accumulation observed in tissues or plasma over time. Additionally, UPA is excreted into milk in lactating rats but does not significantly transfer to the fetus, indicating limited fetal exposure.

These findings are essential for understanding UPA's safety and pharmacokinetic profile, particularly its potential drug interactions and long-term human elimination.

#### **4.2.2.6. Pharmacokinetic drug interactions** {#4.2.2.6.-pharmacokinetic-drug-interactions}

Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies were not conducted explicitly for upadacitinib (UPA). However, the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs can be inferred based on the metabolic pathways through which UPA is processed in the body, specifically through cytochrome P450 enzymes and other hepatic systems. Understanding these metabolic interactions is essential for evaluating the risk of interactions that may affect the pharmacokinetics of UPA in clinical settings.

**Metabolism and Enzyme Involvement**

UPA undergoes hepatic metabolism primarily through the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP3A5 have been identified as the major enzymes involved in its biotransformation.

* **CYP3A4** is the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of UPA. Studies show that it metabolizes UPA to several minor metabolites. The extent of CYP3A4's metabolism is critical because inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme could potentially increase or decrease UPA plasma concentrations, thereby altering its therapeutic effect and safety profile.

* **CYP2D6** also plays a significant role in UPA metabolism, with studies indicating that CYP2D6 partially metabolizes UPA. Drug interactions with inhibitors or inducers of CYP2D6 could affect UPA's metabolism and, in turn, its pharmacokinetics.

* **CYP3A5**, another P450 enzyme, contributes to UPA metabolism but to a lesser extent than CYP3A4 and CYP2D6.

The apparent Km and Vmax values for CYP3A4 metabolism of UPA were calculated using Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics. The Km value (Michaelis constant) for UPA metabolism by CYP3A4 was 8.32 µM, and the Vmax (maximum rate of metabolism) was 0.71 pmol/min/pmol CYP3A4. These values indicate the affinity of CYP3A4 for UPA and the rate at which the enzyme metabolizes the drug, providing insight into the potential for interaction with other drugs metabolized by the same enzyme.

**Potential Drug Interactions**

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors**: Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, and grapefruit juice, may increase UPA plasma concentrations by reducing metabolism. This could increase the risk of dose-dependent adverse effects, such as immunosuppression, renal toxicity, and liver dysfunction. Care should be taken when co-administering UPA with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.

* **CYP3A4 Inducers**: Conversely, CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's Wort may decrease UPA plasma concentrations by accelerating its metabolism. This could reduce UPA's therapeutic effectiveness, especially its anti-inflammatory effects. Monitoring the clinical response to UPA is recommended when co-administering with CYP3A4 inducers.

* **CYP2D6 Inhibitors**: Since CYP2D6 is also involved in UPA metabolism, drugs that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine) could affect the levels of UPA and its metabolites. However, since CYP3A4 plays a more predominant role, the interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors may be less significant.

* **Drug–Drug Interaction Studies**: Although no formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted, understanding how CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 metabolism UPA allows predictions of possible interactions. Care should be exercised when combining UPA with medications that affect the activity of these enzymes.

**Impact of Renal and Hepatic Impairment on UPA Pharmacokinetics**

The pharmacokinetics of UPA may also be influenced by hepatic and renal function. Impaired hepatic function can alter the metabolism of UPA due to reduced activity of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. In patients with severe liver impairment, dose adjustment may be necessary, and careful monitoring is advised. Similarly, in patients with renal impairment, the clearance of UPA and its metabolites could be altered, potentially requiring dose adjustments to maintain therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects.

**Considerations in Special Populations**

* **Pregnancy and Lactation**: No dedicated pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies have been conducted in pregnant or lactating individuals. However, preclinical studies have demonstrated that UPA does not cross the placental barrier to significant levels. Further studies are warranted to assess the full extent of drug-drug interactions during pregnancy and lactation.

* **Age-Related Differences**: Pharmacokinetic studies across different age groups (e.g., pediatric, elderly) have not been fully addressed. Age-related changes in hepatic and renal function could alter the metabolism and elimination of UPA, thus influencing its therapeutic and safety profile.

#### **4.2.2.7. Other pharmacokinetic studies** {#4.2.2.7.-other-pharmacokinetic-studies}

Other pharmacokinetic studies conducted for upadacitinib (UPA) provided additional insights into its pharmacokinetic properties under specific conditions. These studies, which include data from various animal models and further testing, aim to explore the potential variability in UPA pharmacokinetics based on factors such as pre-existing conditions, co-administered drugs, or physiological changes that could affect drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME).

**1\. Studies in Renally Impaired Animals:**

Although no dedicated studies on UPA pharmacokinetics in renally impaired animals were presented, it is essential to consider how renal dysfunction might affect UPA's pharmacokinetics. Since UPA undergoes extensive metabolism and elimination, primarily through the liver and bile, its excretion via the kidneys is minimal. However, the pharmacokinetic parameters such as half-life and exposure levels could change if renal impairment occurs. Further studies on renally impaired models could help predict differences in UPA's pharmacokinetics in patients with renal dysfunction.

**2\. Pharmacokinetics in Hepatically Impaired Animals:**

Cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP3A5 primarily mediate the metabolism of UPA. Studies on hepatically impaired animals could provide insights into how liver dysfunction may alter UPA pharmacokinetics. Specifically, impaired liver function could reduce the clearance of UPA due to a decrease in enzyme activity, leading to higher drug exposure and a longer half-life.

**3\. Impact of Food on Absorption:**

While not directly related to disease conditions, pharmacokinetic studies often explore food's impact on a drug's absorption. Food can alter gastric pH, bile secretion, and gut motility, potentially affecting the bioavailability of orally administered drugs. Although no specific food-effect studies were presented for UPA, such studies are essential for understanding whether UPA should be administered with or without food, which could influence peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the time to reach peak concentration (Tmax).

**4\. Co-administration with Other Drugs:**

Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies are critical to understanding co-administered drugs' impact on UPA’s absorption, metabolism, and excretion. Given that UPA is metabolized by enzymes such as CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP3A5, drugs that inhibit or induce these enzymes could alter UPA’s pharmacokinetics.

For example:

* **CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., Ketoconazole, Itraconazole)**: Combining UPA with CYP3A4 inhibitors could decrease UPA metabolism, leading to higher drug concentrations and an increased risk of side effects. In this case, UPA doses may need to be adjusted when combined with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.

* **CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., Rifampin, and Carbamazepine)**: Conversely, co-administration of UPA with CYP3A4 inducers may increase UPA metabolism, reducing its systemic exposure and potentially reducing its efficacy. This interaction may necessitate UPA dose adjustments to maintain therapeutic levels.

* **CYP2D6 Inhibitors (e.g., Fluoxetine, Paroxetine)**: Since UPA is partially metabolized by CYP2D6, co-administration with CYP2D6 inhibitors could decrease its metabolism, potentially leading to higher plasma concentrations. In such cases, it may be necessary to monitor patients for signs of UPA toxicity.

**5\. Impact of Disease Models on Pharmacokinetics:**

Studies on the pharmacokinetics of UPA in various disease models (e.g., autoimmune diseases, inflammatory conditions) are essential for understanding how altered physiological states may impact drug behavior. In these models, changes in gut permeability, liver function, or enzyme expression can influence UPA absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion.

For example:

* **Autoimmune Models**: In diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, changes in the gastrointestinal system (e.g., altered pH or motility) may affect UPA absorption. Additionally, inflammatory cytokines and enzymes can influence liver function and CYP450 enzyme expression, potentially altering drug metabolism.  
* **Inflammatory States**: Inflammation can impact drug distribution, as inflammatory markers may affect tissue permeability, protein binding, and drug sequestration in specific organs, such as the liver or lungs. These changes could affect the pharmacokinetics of UPA and its efficacy in treating inflammatory diseases.

**6\. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetic Studies in Special Populations:**

Pharmacokinetic studies in special populations, such as pregnant or lactating animals, provide valuable information regarding the safety and potential effects of UPA on fetal development or the drug's excretion into breast milk. Although data from pregnant or lactating animals are not provided for UPA, such studies could reveal critical insights into the drug's impact on maternal and fetal pharmacokinetics and safety.

For example:

* **Pregnancy**: UPA could potentially cross the placenta, and pharmacokinetic studies in pregnant animals would be essential to assess the risk of fetal exposure and potential teratogenic effects. These studies can also evaluate maternal drug exposure and its implications for both maternal and fetal health.

* **Lactation**: If UPA is excreted into milk, it could affect nursing offspring. Studies on lactating animals would help determine whether the drug is present in milk and what potential effects it could have on infant development.

**7\. Other Pharmacokinetic Studies on Drug Formulations:**

Pharmacokinetic studies also evaluate the effects of different drug formulations on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of UPA. This includes assessing the impact of various excipients and drug delivery systems (e.g., immediate-release vs. extended-release formulations). Different formulations could affect UPA’s bioavailability, systemic exposure, and half-life.

In conclusion, while several pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted on UPA, further studies investigating its interactions with co-administered drugs, the effect of disease states, and the impact of different formulations would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its pharmacokinetic properties. Such studies are essential for ensuring UPA's safe and effective use, particularly in patients with varying disease states or those receiving multiple therapies.

### **4.2.3. Toxicology** {#4.2.3.-toxicology}

#### **4.2.3.1. Single dose toxicity** {#4.2.3.1.-single-dose-toxicity}

Single-dose toxicity studies were performed to determine the immediate effects of upadacitinib (UPA) after a single administration at high doses. While no dedicated single-dose toxicity studies were conducted, significant findings were reported during the 28-day repeat-dose toxicity studies, which included mortality after a single dose of upadacitinib at high levels. The mortality observed was linked to severe toxic effects, especially at doses of 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg. This section provides a detailed overview of these findings, including the dose-response relationship and the associated toxicological effects observed in various animal species.

**Study Overview**

* **Study Design**: The single-dose toxicity assessment was embedded within a repeat-dose toxicity study, specifically a 28-day study in Sprague-Dawley rats. Mortality due to overdose was observed during the initial phase of the dosing period and was linked to the high dose administered.  
* **Species/Strain**: Sprague-Dawley rats  
* **Route of Administration**: Oral (PO)  
* **Doses Administered**: 0, 10, 50, 100, 200 mg/kg/day  
* **GLP Compliance**: Yes  
* **Study Number**: TA11-224

**Key Findings and Observations**

1. **Mortality**

   * Mortality occurred within the first 1–3 days of dosing at 200 mg/kg/day. Specifically, 4 males and 6 females at 200 mg/kg died on Day 1 due to extreme toxicity. The remaining rats in this treatment group (at 200 mg/kg) were euthanized on Day 2 or 3, and these animals were discarded without further examination.  
   * A single male rat in the 100 mg/kg/day group also died due to the effects of UPA. The cause of death in this case was linked to lymphoid suppression, degenerative and atrophic changes in the kidney tubules, and moderate to marked multifocal, midzonal, or diffuse liver necrosis in three out of the five males in the group.  
2. **Target Organs of Toxicity** The organs identified as primary targets for toxicity were the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, kidney, and liver. Histopathological findings in these organs led to the conclusion that the toxic effects of UPA were primarily immunosuppressive and affected lymphoid tissues:

   * **Bone Marrow**: Hypocellularity was observed in the bone marrow, particularly in the 100 mg/kg/day group. This finding was reversible after discontinuation of dosing.  
   * **Spleen and Thymus**: Decreases in lymphocyte populations in the marginal zone of the spleen and in the cortex and medulla of the thymus were noted. These reversible changes indicated a suppression of immune function caused by UPA.  
   * **Kidneys**: Tubular degeneration and associated pathological changes were noted in males and females in the 100 mg/kg/day group, correlating with increased urinary protein, bilirubin, blood, and urobilinogen levels. These renal effects were reversible, highlighting potential kidney toxicity at high doses of UPA.  
   * **Liver**: Significant liver damage, including multifocal, midzonal, or diffuse necrosis, was noted in male rats at the 100 mg/kg/day dose. However, this effect was not observed in animals that survived until the scheduled sacrifice or end of the recovery period.  
3. **Clinical Signs and Symptoms**

   * **Skin Lesions**: In the 50 mg/kg/day group, one male rat was euthanized on Day 26 due to severe skin ulceration. This was considered a non-dose-dependent effect, not associated with the drug treatment, as no similar effects were observed in the other rats in the group. The ulceration was speculated to be a result of the drug's immunosuppressive effects, though it was deemed unrelated to the primary toxicology findings.  
4. **Dose-Response Relationship**

   * **Non-linear Increase in AUC**: The systemic exposure to UPA, as measured by the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), increased in a greater-than-dose-proportional manner for the 10 and 50 mg/kg/day groups. However, a dose-proportional increase in exposure was observed for the 50 and 100 mg/kg/day doses. This suggests that at higher doses, the absorption or distribution of UPA may become saturated, leading to a disproportionate increase in systemic exposure.  
   * **NOAEL**: Based on the observations, a **No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL)** of **50 mg/kg/day** was established for this study. Although mortality occurred at higher doses (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg), the effects at the lower dose levels were not severe enough to affect the overall health of the animals. The skin ulceration observed at 50 mg/kg/day in a single animal was judged to be unrelated to the test article.  
5. **Reversibility of Toxic Effects**

   * Several of the toxic effects observed in the high-dose groups, including kidney degeneration, lymphocyte depletion, and bone marrow hypocellularity, were reversible after dosing was discontinued. This reversibility suggests that the toxicity of UPA is primarily dose-dependent and may not cause permanent damage at lower, clinically relevant doses.

The single-dose toxicity data, derived from the 28-day repeat-dose study, suggest that upadacitinib can cause significant toxicity at high doses, particularly affecting the immune system, liver, and kidneys. The observed toxicity was dose-dependent, with more severe effects noted at 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg doses. Notably, the effects were reversible upon treatment discontinuation, and based on the findings, a NOAEL of 50 mg/kg/day was established.

The study indicates that while upadacitinib is generally well-tolerated at lower doses, careful dose management is required to avoid severe adverse effects, particularly in the immune and organ systems. These findings provide critical information for the clinical evaluation of upadacitinib and highlight the need for monitoring during treatment, especially for patients receiving higher doses.

#### **4.2.3.2. Repeat dose toxicity** {#4.2.3.2.-repeat-dose-toxicity}

Repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted to assess the potential adverse effects of upadacitinib (UPA) following prolonged exposure, which is crucial for understanding the drug's long-term safety profile. The studies were designed to evaluate the nature, severity, and dose-dependence of any toxicological findings and identify the no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL). These studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats and Beagle dogs, using oral administration to simulate the clinical use of UPA.

**Summary of Findings in Rats**

**28-Day Repeat-Dose Oral Toxicity Study (Study No. TA11-224, GLP)**  
 This study involved administering UPA to Sprague-Dawley rats for 28 days and a subsequent 4-week recovery period to assess the reversibility of any observed toxic effects. Doses of 0, 10, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day were used, with the 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day groups being the primary focus due to the significant mortality observed at the highest doses.

* **Mortality and Toxicity Observations:**

  * Severe toxicity was observed at the highest dose of 200 mg/kg/day, with mortality occurring on Day 1 of the study. A total of 4 males and 6 females were found dead or were sacrificed due to extreme toxicity at this dose. The remaining 200 mg/kg/day rats were sacrificed on Day 2 or 3\.  
  * In the 100 mg/kg/day group, 5 males out of 15 died, and the cause of death was attributed to lymphoid suppression, kidney degeneration, and liver necrosis. These findings were particularly severe in male rats, where marked multifocal liver necrosis and degenerative kidney changes were observed.  
  * No deaths occurred at the 50 mg/kg/day dose, and no significant adverse effects were observed at the lower doses (10 mg/kg/day and 0 mg/kg/day).  
* **Target Organs of Toxicity:**

  * The primary target organs for UPA toxicity were the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, kidneys, and liver.  
  * Bone Marrow Toxicity:  
    * Hypocellularity was observed in the bone marrow of both males and females at 100 mg/kg/day. This finding was **reversible** during recovery, suggesting that the bone marrow's regenerating capacity was not permanently compromised at this dose.  
  * Spleen and Thymus Toxicity:  
    * Lymphocyte depletion in the spleen and thymus was observed for both sexes at the 100 mg/kg/day dose. These changes were reversible and considered a result of UPA's immunosuppressive properties, a known effect of JAK inhibitors.  
  * Kidney Toxicity:  
    * At 100 mg/kg/day, tubular degeneration was noted in the kidneys of both sexes, with accompanying changes in urinary parameters, including increased protein, bilirubin, and blood urobilinogen. These findings were reversible.  
  * Liver Toxicity:  
    * Necrosis in the liver was noted in males at 100 mg/kg/day, particularly in those who died early in the study. However, no liver necrosis was seen in surviving animals at this dose during the scheduled sacrifice or the recovery period.  
* **Pharmacokinetics Observations:**

  * Systemic Exposure:  
    * The 10 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day doses had a greater-than-dose-proportional increase in AUC (area under the curve). In contrast, the 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day doses exhibited approximately dose-proportional increases in exposure.  
  * NOAEL Determination:  
    * The NOAEL for this study was established at 50 mg/kg/day despite the skin ulceration observed in one male rat at this dose, which was not observed in any other animal at this or higher doses. Since similar findings were not found in subsequent studies, this adverse event was deemed unrelated to the treatment.

**26-Week Repeat-Dose Oral Toxicity Study in Rats (Study No. TA12-067, GLP)**  
A longer, 26-week repeat-dose study was conducted to assess the chronic effects of UPA in Sprague-Dawley rats. Doses of 0, 5, 20, and 50 mg/kg/day were administered, with 20 rats per sex per group.

**Key Toxicological Findings:**

* Kidney Toxicity:  
  * Minimal to moderate tubular degeneration/regeneration in the kidneys was observed at 50 mg/kg/day, with histopathological changes observed in both sexes. This kidney toxicity was dose-limiting and led to the identification of the NOAEL at 20 mg/kg/day.  
  * Lymphoid Depletion:  
    * Lymphoid depletion in the thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes was noted for both males and females, particularly at the 50 mg/kg/day dose. These changes were also considered monitorable in a clinical setting and correlated with reduced lymphocyte counts.  
  * Oral Mucosa and Tongue Toxicity:  
    * At doses ≥ 20 mg/kg/day, both sexes' tongues showed mild erosion and chronic inflammation. These changes were considered monitorable and likely related to UPA's immunosuppressive activity.  
  * Systemic Exposure:  
    * Systemic exposure to UPA (AUC and Cmax) generally increased in a greater-than-dose proportional manner. At 50 mg/kg/day, a slight accumulation was observed by Day 178, and a significant increase in drug exposure was observed between Day 1 and Day 178 for both males and females.  
* **NOAEL Determination:**

  * The NOAEL for this study was established at 20 mg/kg/day based on histopathological findings, particularly in the kidneys. These findings were considered dose-limiting, and the study provided clear evidence of chronic toxicity in target organs, including the kidneys, lymphoid tissues, and oral mucosa.

**Summary of Findings in Dogs**

**4-Week Repeat-Dose Oral Toxicity Study in Beagle Dogs (Study No. TB11-225, GLP)**  
This study was designed to assess the short-term toxicity of UPA in Beagle dogs. It used​​ 0, 0.5, 1.5, 3, and 5 mg/kg/day doses. A total of 4 males and 4 females were included in each dose group. The study was followed by a four-week recovery period.

* **Key Toxicological Findings:**

  * Spleen and Thymus Toxicity:  
    * At doses ≥ 3 mg/kg/day, the weights of the spleen, thymus, and ovary decreased slightly, indicating potential immunosuppressive effects. Histopathological examination confirmed these findings, with decreases in lymphocytes in these tissues.  
  * Bone Marrow Toxicity:  
    * Hypocellularity in the bone marrow was observed at ≥ 3 mg/kg/day, a reversible finding after recovery.  
  * Lymphoid Depletion:  
    * A decrease in lymphocytes in the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus was observed in males and females at doses ≥ 3 mg/kg/day. This was consistent with the known pharmacodynamic effects of UPA and considered monitorable in a clinical setting.  
  * Other Observations:  
    * No significant changes were noted in body weight, ophthalmology, clinical chemistry, or gross pathology, indicating that the observed toxicities were not severe or life-threatening.  
* **NOAEL Determination:**

  * The NOAEL for this study was determined to be 5 mg/kg/day. The findings were attributed to the immunosuppressive effects of UPA and were considered monitorable in clinical practice.

**39-Week Chronic Oral Toxicity Study in Beagle Dogs (Study No. TB12-042, GLP)**  
 This long-term study aimed to assess the chronic toxicity of UPA in Beagle dogs. Dogs were dosed with 0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.5 mg/kg/day of UPA for 39 weeks.

* **Key Toxicological Findings:**

  * Skin Toxicity:  
    * Skin swelling of the forepaws and hindpaws was observed at doses ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, with more significant skin lesions, including cutaneous inflammation and demodicosis, noted at the 1.5 mg/kg/day dose. This skin toxicity was dose-dependent.  
  * Hematological Toxicity:  
    * Increased white blood cell counts, particularly neutrophil and monocyte levels, were observed in both sexes at 1.5 mg/kg/day. Concurrently, decreased red blood cell, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values were noted, which were dose-dependent.  
  * Lymphoid Toxicity:  
    * Mixed cell inflammation was observed in the lymph nodes (popliteal and precapsular) at ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, consistent with UPA's immunosuppressive effects.  
    * Lymphocyte depletion was also noted in the spleen and thymus of male dogs at 0.5 mg/kg/day and 1.5 mg/kg/day, reinforcing earlier studies' findings.  
* **NOAEL Determination:**

  * The NOAEL for this study was established at 1.5 mg/kg/day, based on the observed skin lesions and hematological changes at higher doses.

#### **4.2.3.3. Genotoxicity** {#4.2.3.3.-genotoxicity}

Genotoxicity studies are crucial in assessing a compound's potential to cause genetic damage that could lead to cancer, mutations, or congenital disabilities. In vitro and in vivo studies evaluated upadacitinib (UPA) for its mutagenic and clastogenic potential.

##### **4.2.3.3.1. In vitro** {#4.2.3.3.1.-in-vitro}

**Study Title: Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay (Ames Test) with A-1293543 Free Form (Study No. R\&D/11/1293)**  
 The bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay is a widely used method to detect potential mutagenic activity of compounds by identifying their ability to induce mutations in bacterial cells. In this study, UPA was tested up to the limit dose of 5000 µg/plate, both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation (S9 mix). The Ames test uses a range of bacterial strains (e.g., Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli) that can detect various types of mutations.

* **Key Findings**:  
  * UPA did not induce a significant increase in revertant colony counts compared to the control group, either with or without the S9 mix.  
  * Positive controls demonstrated expected increases in revertant colonies, confirming the validity of the assay.  
  * Conclusion: UPA was not mutagenic in the Ames test, indicating no direct genetic mutations were induced in bacteria by UPA.

**Study Title: In Vitro Mammalian Chromosome Aberration Test with A-1293543 Free Form (Study No. R\&D/11/1294)**  
 This study evaluated the potential of UPA to cause chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, an assay considered essential for detecting genotoxicity in mammalian cells. The test was conducted in the presence and absence of metabolic activation (S9 mix), with two different incubation times: 4 hours with S9 and 20 hours without S9.

* **Key Findings**:  
  * In the presence and absence of S9, UPA did not induce chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes.  
  * A slight increase in numerical chromosomal aberrations, such as polyploidy and aneuploidy, was observed at both 4 and 20-hour incubation periods, but these were not significant or considered to have mutagenic potential.  
  * Positive controls exhibited statistically significant increases in aberrant cells, supporting the reliability of the assay.  
  * Conclusion: UPA was not clastogenic (i.e., did not cause chromosomal damage) under the conditions tested. However, some minor numerical aberrations were observed without metabolic activation, which warrants further investigation in different systems to understand its clinical relevance.

##### **4.2.3.3.2. In vivo** {#4.2.3.3.2.-in-vivo}

**Study Title: Rat Bone Marrow Micronucleus Test with A-1293543 Free Form (Study No. R\&D/12/350)**  
 The micronucleus test is an in vivo assay that detects chromosomal damage by measuring the formation of micronuclei in bone marrow cells, which is indicative of genetic damage. In this study, male rats were administered UPA orally at doses up to 150 mg/kg, the highest dose tested, and the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) was evaluated.

* **Key Findings**:  
  * No significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated PCEs was observed in UPA-treated rats compared to the control group, indicating no genotoxic effect at the doses tested.  
  * Piloerection was observed at 150 mg/kg, but this was not related to genetic toxicity.  
  * The positive control group showed the expected increase in micronucleated PCEs, confirming the validity of the assay.  
  * Conclusion: UPA was not clastogenic in the rat micronucleus assay, suggesting that UPA does not induce chromosomal damage in vivo at the tested doses.

#### **4.2.3.4. Carcinogenicity** {#4.2.3.4.-carcinogenicity}

Carcinogenicity studies for Upadacitinib (UPA) were conducted in mice and rats to assess the potential for long-term carcinogenic effects, following the guidelines provided by ICH M3 and regulatory agencies. These studies were designed to evaluate the long-term risks of UPA administration, with careful attention to dose selection, study duration, and relevance to the drug's proposed clinical use.

##### **4.2.3.4.1. Long term studies** {#4.2.3.4.1.-long-term-studies}

**Study Title: A-1293543 Free Form \[ABT-494\]: A 26-Week Oral Gavage Carcinogenicity Study in Model 001178-T (Hemizygous) CBYB6F1TG(HRAS)2JIC Mice (Study No. TD16-088)**

* **Study Design and Methodology**  
   This 26-week carcinogenicity study in transgenic (TgRas) mice was designed to evaluate the potential tumorigenic effects of UPA. Male and female CByB6F1-TgN mice (25/sex/group) received UPA by oral gavage at doses of 0, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg/day. The positive control group received a single intraperitoneal injection of 75 mg/kg N-nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU) on Day 1\. The study was conducted under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions, with a treatment duration of 26 weeks for both sexes.

* **Key Findings**  
   The study revealed no statistically significant test article-related tumor findings in either male or female mice, indicating that UPA did not induce carcinogenicity at the administered doses. Systemic exposure to UPA, as noted in the mean AUC, was 844 ng*hr/mL for males and 1440 ng*hr/mL for females at the high dose (20 mg/kg/day). No drug-related neoplasms were observed, suggesting that UPA does not have carcinogenic potential in this transgenic mouse model.

* **Conclusion**  
   The results of this study indicate that UPA does not induce carcinogenic effects in TgRas mice. The Executive Carcinogenicity Assessment Committee (ECAC) deemed the study adequate, concurring with the doses and design. The findings support the safety profile of UPA in terms of carcinogenic risk.

**Study Title: 104-Week Oral Dose (Gavage) Carcinogenicity Study with A-1293543 Hydrate C in Sprague-Dawley Rats (Study No. TA15-032)**

* **Study Design and Methodology**  
   This long-term carcinogenicity study was conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats to assess the carcinogenic potential of UPA. Male and female SD rats (70 rats/sex/group) received UPA at doses of 0, 4, 7.5, and 15 mg/kg/day for males and 0, 3, 7.5, and 20 mg/kg/day for females. The study spanned 104 weeks, comprehensively evaluating UPA’s long-term effects. The doses were selected based on results from earlier toxicology studies, including a 6-month study that showed no significant adverse effects at higher doses.

* **Key Findings**  
   Throughout the 104-week study, no test article-related effects on mortality were observed, and no statistically significant drug-related tumors were detected in male or female rats. Systemic exposure to UPA, as measured by AUC, was 1.67 µg*hr/mL at the high dose (15 mg/kg/day) for males and 4.17 µg*hr/mL at the high dose (20 mg/kg/day) for females. The study also revealed no dose-related increase in the incidence of neoplasms, indicating that UPA does not induce carcinogenicity in rats over a 2-year treatment period.

* **Conclusion**  
   The 104-week carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrated that UPA does not induce carcinogenicity in either male or female rats, even at high doses. The study was conducted under GLP conditions, and the ECAC reviewed and concurred with the study design and results. These findings further support the safety of UPA in long-term use, with no indication of carcinogenic risk.

##### **4.2.3.4.2. Short or medium term studies** {#4.2.3.4.2.-short-or-medium-term-studies}

No specific short-term or medium-term carcinogenicity studies were provided for UPA in addition to the long-term studies described above. However, the data obtained from the 26-week mouse and 104-week rat studies serve as the pivotal carcinogenicity evaluations for UPA. These studies were considered comprehensive in evaluating the potential long-term risks of UPA exposure and were deemed sufficient for regulatory submission.

##### **4.2.3.4.3 Summary and Rationale for Carcinogenicity Evaluation** {#4.2.3.4.3-summary-and-rationale-for-carcinogenicity-evaluation}

UPA's carcinogenicity evaluation included a 26-week study in transgenic mice and a 104-week study in rats. These studies were conducted by ICH and regulatory guidelines and utilized the recommended species for carcinogenicity testing. The dose selection was based on prior toxicology data, ensuring that the study covered a broad dose range to assess the potential carcinogenic risks of UPA adequately.

Both studies revealed no evidence of drug-related tumors, and systemic exposure to UPA was within the expected range for therapeutic use in humans. Thus, these studies support the conclusion that UPA does not pose a carcinogenic risk in the tested species at the doses used.

Given the comprehensive nature of these studies and the lack of any observed carcinogenic effects, no further carcinogenicity studies are considered necessary for UPA, and the findings support the drug's safety profile in this regard.

#### **4.2.3.5. Reproductive and developmental toxicity** {#4.2.3.5.-reproductive-and-developmental-toxicity}

Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were conducted to evaluate the potential effects of Upadacitinib (UPA) on fertility, early embryonic development, embryo-fetal development, and prenatal/postnatal development. These studies were designed to assess the risk of UPA in terms of its potential to affect reproduction and offspring development. The studies involved dosing in both rats and rabbits, and comprehensive toxicokinetic evaluations were conducted to determine the systemic exposure to UPA and its metabolites during these studies. The studies were GLP-compliant, and the data have been reviewed under IND 114,717. Below is a summary of the key findings from each of the relevant studies:

##### **4.2.3.5.1. Fertility and early embryonic development** {#4.2.3.5.1.-fertility-and-early-embryonic-development}

**Study Title: An Oral Fertility Study with A-1293543 in Rats (Study No. TA13-312)**  
 This GLP-compliant oral fertility study was conducted in rats to assess the effects of UPA on fertility and early embryonic development. Male and female rats were dosed with UPA at 0 (vehicle), 5, 25, 50 (males), and 75 mg/kg/day for 14 days before mating, through mating and post-mating periods (males), and through mating period to gestation day (GD) 7 (females). The primary endpoints included effects on mating and fertility indices, body weight changes, and early embryonic development.

* **Key Findings:**  
  * **Body Weight Effects:** Significant decreases in body weight gain were observed in male rats at doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg/day during the pre-mating period (28% and 29%, respectively) and 47% decrease in body weight gain in males during the post-mating period (study days 32-36) at 5 mg/kg/day. The body weight effects were considered adverse and were likely related to UPA’s pharmacodynamic effects.  
  * **Maternal NOAEL:** The maternal NOAEL was 25 mg/kg/day, based on weight loss at 75 mg/kg/day during gestation.  
  * **Fertility and Mating Indices:** No significant effects on fertility or mating indices were observed, indicating that UPA did not affect the rats' ability to mate or produce offspring.  
  * **Early Embryonic Development:** Postimplantation loss, an increased number of resorptions, and decreased numbers of live concepti per litter were observed in the 25 mg/kg/day treatment group, with more severe effects at the highest dose of 75 mg/kg/day. At 75 mg/kg/day, 82% of post-implantation loss and a mean of 2 viable fetuses per litter were observed. These effects were considered adverse, and the NOAEL for early embryonic development was established at 5 mg/kg/day.  
  * **Conclusion:** UPA did not significantly impact fertility but caused adverse effects on early embryonic development, particularly at doses ≥25 mg/kg/day. Based on these findings, UPA is considered to affect early embryonic development at doses that also cause maternal weight loss.

##### **4.2.3.5.2. Embryofetal development** {#4.2.3.5.2.-embryofetal-development}

**Study Title: An Oral Developmental Toxicity Study with A-1293543 in Rats (Study No. TA12-095)**  
 This GLP-compliant study assessed the potential for UPA to cause developmental toxicity in rats. From GD 6 to GD 17, female rats were dosed with UPA at 0 (vehicle), 5, 25, and 75 mg/kg/day. The study included a comprehensive toxicokinetic evaluation of UPA to assess the relationship between drug exposure and developmental effects.

* **Key Findings:**  
  * **Maternal Toxicity:** No maternal mortality was observed. However, at 75 mg/kg/day, mean litter fetal body weight significantly decreased at GD 20\. Despite the lack of significant maternal toxicity, developmental effects, including skeletal malformations, were noted.  
  * **Skeletal Malformations:** UPA exposure was associated with increased skeletal malformations in the offspring at doses ≥25 mg/kg/day. These malformations included misshapen forelimbs (humerus) and bent scapula. In the high dose group (75 mg/kg/day), additional skeletal malformations such as absent cervical vertebra and bent forelimbs (radius) were observed. These findings were consistent with UPA’s teratogenic potential.  
  * **Skeletal Variations:** Skeletal variations, including bent and rudimentary ribs, additional ossification of the neural arch (cervical vertebra), and non-ossified sternebra (sternum), were observed across all treatment groups. These variations were dose-dependent, with more pronounced effects in the higher-dose groups.  
  * **Developmental NOAEL:** The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 75 mg/kg/day (AUC 33.4 µg\*hr/mL). The developmental NOAEL was not determined, as skeletal malformations were observed at the lowest dose tested (25 mg/kg/day). Therefore, UPA is considered teratogenic in rats.  
  * **Conclusion:** UPA induced significant skeletal malformations and variations in rat offspring, indicating a risk for developmental toxicity at doses ≥25 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicity was not evident at these doses, but developmental effects, including teratogenicity, were apparent.

##### **4.2.3.5.3. Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function** {#4.2.3.5.3.-prenatal-and-postnatal-development,-including-maternal-function}

**Study Title: An Oral (Gavage) Pre-/Postnatal Developmental Toxicity Study of A-1293543 in Rats (Study No. TA16-197)**  
 In this GLP-compliant study, pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats (F0 generation) were dosed orally with UPA at 0 (vehicle), 2.5 (low dose), 5 (mid-dose), and 10 (high dose) mg/kg/day from GD 6 to lactation day (LD) 20\. The F1 generation was evaluated for postnatal development, including behavioral and functional assessments. Toxicokinetic evaluations were also performed to assess UPA exposure in the F0 and F1 generations.

* **Key Findings:**  
  * **Gestation and Delivery:** The mean gestation length, implantation sites, and number of pups delivered per litter were comparable across all treatment groups. These results suggest that UPA treatment had no significant impact on gestation or parturition.  
  * **Maternal NOAEL:** The maternal NOAEL was established at 10 mg/kg/day, based on the absence of significant effects on maternal body weight, gestation, and delivery parameters.  
  * **F1 Generation Development:** No significant effects on postnatal development, including body weight, sexual maturation, or behavioral assessments (acoustic startle test, motor activity test, water maze test), were observed in the F1 generation. Additionally, no adverse effects on fertility in the F1 generation were observed.  
  * **Toxicokinetics:** UPA was detected in the plasma of F1 pups, with concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (\<5.25 ng/mL) in the control and 2.5 mg/kg/day groups. At higher doses (5 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day), UPA plasma concentrations were 4.32 ng/mL and 10.9 ng/mL, respectively.  
  * **Conclusion:** No effects were observed on maternal function or the development of the F1 generation, indicating that UPA does not adversely affect prenatal or postnatal development when administered at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for both maternal and developmental toxicity was established at 10 mg/kg/day.

#### **4.2.3.6. Special toxicology studies** {#4.2.3.6.-special-toxicology-studies}

Special toxicology studies were conducted to investigate specific safety concerns that may not have been addressed in the general toxicity assessments. These studies included investigations into immunotoxicity, phototoxicity, and antigenicity. These are crucial to evaluate any potential effects on immune function, skin sensitivity, or other unusual toxicity profiles not observed in standard repeat-dose or single-dose studies.

**T-Cell Dependent Antibody Response (TDAR) Assay**

**Study Title: T-Cell Dependent Antibody Response Assay using A-1293543 Free Base in Sprague-Dawley Rats (Study No. TA15-053, GLP)**

* **Objective**: This study evaluated whether modulating a T-cell-dependent response (TDAR) in Sprague-Dawley rats: Addition and assessed the reproducibility of any observed test article-related effects.  
* **Methodology**: Sprague-Dawley rats (10/sex/group) were dosed orally with UPA at 0, 5, 30, or 60 mg/kg/day. A primary study cohort received treatment for 8 weeks, during which a TDAR assay was conducted during the last 4 weeks of dosing. A separate cohort of animals at 0 and 60 mg/kg/day received treatment for 4 weeks, followed by a 16-week recovery phase, and a second TDAR assay was conducted during the recovery phase.  
* **Key Findings**:  
  * **Body Weight**: Males in the 60 mg/kg/day group exhibited a decrease in body weight gain (-14%) relative to control animals. However, these changes were reversible after the cessation of dosing.  
  * **Lymphocyte Counts**: At doses ≥5 mg/kg/day, mean lymphocyte counts decreased dose-dependently during the dosing phase (Days 23 and 50\) and the recovery phase. The lymphocyte count reductions were reversible, indicating that the immune suppression induced by UPA is not permanent.  
  * **Anti-KLH IgM and IgG Levels**: Dose-dependent decreases in anti-KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) IgM and IgG concentrations were observed. The suppression of these antibodies suggests that UPA modulates immune function by inhibiting T-cell-dependent B-cell responses.  
  * **Reversibility**: The immunosuppressive effects on the antibody response were reversible after a recovery phase. This indicates that the drug’s effects on immune function were not permanent and could be managed clinically if necessary.  
* **Conclusion**: UPA suppresses the T-cell dependent antibody response under the study conditions. Given that these effects are reversible, UPA can be considered to have a manageable immunosuppressive profile, but care should be taken in clinical settings where immune function is critical.

**Phototoxicity Assessment**

**Study Title: Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Assay of A-1293543 in Balb/c 3T3 Mouse Fibroblasts (Study No. TX13-260, GLP)**

* **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to assess whether UPA has the potential to induce phototoxicity. Phototoxicity refers to a drug’s ability to cause cellular damage or toxicity upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light.  
* **Methodology**: Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were exposed to varying concentrations of UPA (1.78 and 100 mg/mL) in the presence and absence of UV radiation. The viability of the cells was assessed using the neutral red uptake method, where the reduction in viability following UV exposure compared to normal cell viability was measured.  
* **Key Findings**:  
  * **Cell Survival and Viability**: No significant reduction in cell viability was observed after exposure to UPA in the presence of UV light, indicating that UPA does not have phototoxic effects under the conditions of the study.  
  * **Phototoxicity Criteria**: All survival and optical density (OD540) measurements met the OECD 432 criteria, and the positive control (Promethazine) demonstrated the expected cytotoxicity and phototoxicity effects, confirming the assay's validity.  
* **Conclusion**: UPA did not exhibit phototoxicity in the Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Assay, suggesting that it does not risk phototoxic effects in clinical use. This result supports UPA's safety in terms of UV light exposure.

**Antigenicity Study**

**Study Title: Antigenicity Evaluation of A-1293543 in Sprague-Dawley Rats (Study No. TA14-215, Non-GLP)**

* **Objective**: This study evaluated whether UPA has the potential to induce antigenic reactions, which could cause hypersensitivity or allergic responses in humans.  
* **Methodology**: Sprague-Dawley rats (5/sex/group) were administered UPA at doses of 0, 30, 60, and 100 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. The study evaluated the presence of immune responses to UPA by measuring changes in serum immunoglobulin levels and observing any clinical signs indicative of hypersensitivity.  
* **Key Findings**:  
  * **Immune Responses**: No significant increase in the levels of IgE or other immunoglobulins indicative of allergic reactions was observed. Additionally, no clinical signs of hypersensitivity, such as swelling, rashes, or anaphylaxis, were recorded.  
  * **Clinical Observations**: No signs of acute or chronic toxicity related to immune activation were observed, suggesting that UPA does not induce antigenic or allergic responses in rats.  
* **Conclusion**: UPA did not induce rat antigenic reactions under the study conditions. This suggests that UPA does not pose a significant risk of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions in clinical use, which supports its safe use in individuals with normal immune function.

### **5.3.1. Reports of Biopharmaceutic studies** {#5.3.1.-reports-of-biopharmaceutic-studies}

The biopharmaceutic development program for upadacitinib (extended-release tablets) included numerous Phase 1 studies to characterize its absorption, bioavailability, and formulation performance. A total of 22 Phase 1 studies were conducted as part of NDA 211675, covering various aspects of biopharmaceutics​. These investigations encompassed:

* **Relative bioavailability studies** comparing the extended-release (ER) tablet to an immediate-release (IR) formulation under different conditions (e.g. fasted vs fed).  
* **Food-effect evaluations** to determine the impact of a high-fat meal on upadacitinib absorption.  
* **Comparative bioavailability/bioequivalence studies** to bridge formulations used in clinical trials (Phase 2/3) with the to-be-marketed formulation.  
* **In vitro–in vivo correlation (IVIVC) development** to relate in vitro dissolution profiles to in vivo pharmacokinetic performance.  
* **Bioanalytical method development and validation** to ensure accurate measurement of upadacitinib concentrations in plasma for all studies.

Collectively, these studies confirmed that the upadacitinib ER formulation provides adequate bioavailability and consistent exposure across different scenarios. Key findings were that the ER tablet achieves about 76–85% of the exposure of an IR reference (indicating high relative bioavailability), has no clinically significant food effect on absorption​, and is bioequivalent to the formulation used in Phase 3 efficacy trials​. The results of the biopharmaceutic studies supported the selection of a 15 mg once-daily dose and confirmed that upadacitinib ER tablets can be administered with or without food. Detailed summaries of each category of study are presented below.

#### **5.3.1.1. Bioavailability (BA) study reports and related information** {#5.3.1.1.-bioavailability-(ba)-study-reports-and-related-information}

*Absolute and Relative Bioavailability:* No intravenous dosing was performed to directly measure absolute bioavailability (due to the absence of an IV formulation for this oral JAK inhibitor). Instead, the sponsor evaluated relative bioavailability using an oral solution as a reference. In a Phase 1 study, healthy subjects received upadacitinib as two split doses of an oral solution (2×6 mg given 12 hours apart) versus a single 15 mg ER tablet under fasting conditions. The oral solution (which is expected to be absorbed rapidly and nearly completely) produced \~30% higher C\_max and \~17% higher AUC\_inf compared to the 15 mg ER tablet​. This indicates that the ER tablet delivers approximately 85% of the systemic exposure relative to an immediate-release administration. Population PK analyses similarly estimated the ER formulation’s oral bioavailability to be about 76% of that of an IR formulation​. Therefore, while upadacitinib is well-absorbed, the extended-release design causes a modest reduction in total exposure compared to an immediate-release or solution form. Importantly, the observed relative BA was still high enough to achieve the desired systemic levels. The 15 mg ER dose was selected to ensure equivalent exposure to the efficacious IR regimen used in Phase 2 (6 mg BID, total 12 mg/day), as confirmed by comparative BA results (15 mg ER QD provided similar AUC to 6 mg BID IR)​. upadacitinib’s absolute BA is high (fraction absorbed is substantial, though slightly incomplete due to release characteristics), and the ER formulation’s relative BA (\~0.8–0.85) was deemed acceptable for once-daily dosing.

*Food Effect Studies:* The effect of food on upadacitinib bioavailability was evaluated in a dedicated crossover study using a high-fat, high-calorie meal. In one study (Study M14-680), a 30 mg ER dose given with a high-fat meal resulted in a 17% increase in AUC∞ and a 20% increase in C\_max compared to fasting administration​. In a later study with the final market-image formulation (Study M15-878), the food effect was slightly more pronounced: a high-fat meal increased AUC by \~30% and C\_max by \~40% for a 30 mg dose​. Despite these increases in exposure, the food effect was not considered clinically significant​. Upadacitinib’s efficacy and safety margins could accommodate the modest rise in exposure, and no dose adjustment was required. Consequently, the dosing recommendation allows upadacitinib ER tablets to be taken with or without food. The label and clinical guidance reflect that there is no clinically relevant food–drug interaction, meaning patients do not need to adhere to a fed or fasted state for dosing.

*Key Pharmacokinetic Findings and Dosing Implications:* Across the BA studies, upadacitinib exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in the tested dose range (approximately 7.5 mg to 45 mg ER)​. The ER formulation substantially blunts the peak concentration (C\_max) relative to IR dosing, which may improve tolerability. For example, a single 15 mg ER tablet produced a C\_max that was about 63% lower than an equivalent 12 mg IR dose (6 mg BID) while maintaining equal AUC​. This flatter PK profile is advantageous for a once-daily regimen. The BA studies confirmed that the chosen 15 mg QD dose provides plasma exposures in the target therapeutic range, aligning with those that were efficacious in Phase 2 trials. Moreover, since food does not drastically alter exposure, patients have flexibility in dosing. In summary, the absolute/relative BA data and food-effect results support the recommended dosing of upadacitinib 15 mg once daily without regard to meals.

#### **5.3.1.2. Comparative BA and Bioequivalence (BE) study reports and related information** {#5.3.1.2.-comparative-ba-and-bioequivalence-(be)-study-reports-and-related-information}

*Comparative BA – ER vs IR Formulations:* Given that early clinical studies of upadacitinib used an IR formulation (capsules) administered twice daily, bridging studies were performed to compare the pharmacokinetics of the ER tablet to the IR regimen. In Study M14-680 (Phase 1), two parts evaluated upadacitinib ER vs IR: Part 1 compared a single 15 mg ER tablet (ER7 formulation) to a 12 mg dose of IR capsules (given as 6 mg BID), and Part 2 compared a 30 mg ER tablet to a 24 mg IR dose (12 mg BID). The results demonstrated that the ER formulation can effectively replace the IR dosing schedule​. Specifically, 15 mg QD (ER) provided equivalent overall exposure (AUC) to 6 mg BID (IR), with a significantly lower peak level (C\_max was \~63% lower with ER)​. Similarly, 30 mg QD (ER) yielded AUC comparable to 12 mg BID (IR)​file-stwhqrnpqmr2dhxvnhqek5. These findings confirmed that the once-daily ER formulation achieves the same extent of absorption over 24 hours as the split-dose IR regimen, thereby validating the switch to QD dosing for Phase 3 trials. The ER formulation’s slightly lower relative bioavailability (about 80%) was compensated by using a higher total dose (15 mg QD vs 12 mg/day IR) to ensure equivalent exposure. Thus, the comparative BA studies supported dose and formulation bridging from the IR to ER formulation in the clinical development program.

*Bioequivalence – Clinical Trial vs To-Be-Marketed Formulations:* The commercial upadacitinib product was an improved ER tablet formulation (sometimes referred to as “market-image” formulation). To ensure that efficacy and safety data from Phase 3 (which used earlier ER formulations) were applicable to the final product, the sponsor conducted bioequivalence studies. Study M15-878 was a pivotal Phase 1 BE study with two parts: Part 1 evaluated the 30 mg strength and Part 2 evaluated the 15 mg strength. Each part was a randomized crossover in healthy subjects under fasted conditions. In Part 1, the 30 mg to-be-marketed ER tablet (ER18) was directly compared to the 30 mg ER tablet used in Phase 3 trials (ER8). The results indicated bioequivalence – the geometric mean ratios for C\_max and AUC (test vs reference) were within the 80–125% range, with 90% confidence intervals falling well inside the acceptance limits​. In Part 2, the 15 mg commercial ER tablet (ER17) was compared to the Phase 3 15 mg ER tablet (ER7), also demonstrating bioequivalence (all 90% CIs for C\_max, AUC\_0-t, and AUC\_0-inf were comfortably within 0.80–1.25). These BE findings confirm that the pharmacokinetic profiles of the clinical trial formulation and the final market formulation are virtually superimposable. Thus, no differences in efficacy or safety would be expected due to the minor manufacturing/formulation changes, and the Phase 3 trial results can be bridged to the commercial product. Additionally, the high-fat food effect on the market-image formulation was characterized in Study M15-878 Part 1; as noted above, food caused a moderate increase in exposure (\~30% AUC, \~40% C\_max), which was taken into account in labeling (but did not preclude dosing with or without food).

*Comparative BA – Dose Strength Proportionality:* An additional Phase 1 study (Study M15-868) examined the bioavailability of a high dose and the interchangeability of different strength tablets. In this study, a 45 mg ER dose was administered either as a single 45 mg tablet or as a combination of one 30 mg \+ one 15 mg ER tablet (taken together). Under fasting conditions, the single 45 mg tablet provided comparable AUC and C\_max to the 45 mg dose given as two tablets​. In other words, the exposure from 45 mg total dose was the same whether it was delivered in one tablet or split into multiple tablets, indicating dose-proportional kinetics and no formulation interaction when multiple tablets are co-administered. This finding supports the flexibility of using multiple tablets to achieve higher doses if ever needed (e.g. for exploratory high-dose studies or different indications) and confirms linear PK across strengths. The 45 mg study also included a fed vs fasted arm for the single 45 mg tablet; the food effect observed was directionally consistent with that at the 15 mg and 30 mg doses (increased exposure when fed), reinforcing that the absorption mechanism remains similar at higher strengths.

*Statistical and Analytical Methods:* All comparative BA/BE studies were conducted with rigorous statistical analysis per regulatory guidelines. Pharmacokinetic parameters (C\_max, AUC\_0-t, AUC\_0-inf, etc.) were derived by non-compartmental analysis. For bioequivalence evaluations, the log-transformed PK parameters were compared between formulations using ANOVA, and 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of geometric means (test/reference) were calculated. Bioequivalence was concluded if the 90% CI fell within the standard 80–125% equivalence criterion for both AUC and C\_max. For both the 15 mg and 30 mg formulation bridging studies, the results met these criteria, as noted above​. All studies were appropriately powered to detect formulation differences if present, and they included adequate washout periods between treatments for the crossover designs. The analytical methods used to measure drug concentrations in these studies were the validated assays described in Section 5, ensuring reliable data for PK and statistical analysis. In summary, the comparative BA and BE studies confirmed that changes in upadacitinib formulation or strength do not alter its pharmacokinetic behavior, thereby ensuring a consistent dosing performance from clinical development through commercial product.

#### **5.3.1.3. In Vitro-In vivo correlation study reports and related information** {#5.3.1.3.-in-vitro-in-vivo-correlation-study-reports-and-related-information}

Given the extended-release nature of upadacitinib tablets, an in vitro–in vivo correlation (IVIVC) was developed to link the drug’s dissolution characteristics with its in vivo absorption profile. A Level A IVIVC (the most predictive, point-to-point type of correlation) was successfully established. The model development involved multiple ER formulations: several prototype formulations of the 30 mg strength (with varying release rates) and at least one formulation of the 15 mg strength were used to generate a range of dissolution profiles and corresponding plasma concentration profiles​. The data were fitted to a non-linear IVIVC model, as a simple linear correlation was not sufficient (indicating a complex dissolution-absorption relationship). The final model showed an excellent correlation between the fraction of drug dissolved in vitro and the fraction absorbed in vivo for upadacitinib. The IVIVC was validated internally and externally, meaning it was able to predict the observed plasma profiles of upadacitinib from dissolution data with acceptable accuracy​. The predictability was confirmed by meeting predefined criteria (e.g. prediction errors for C\_max and AUC within the acceptable limits), demonstrating that the model could reliably forecast in vivo performance for given in vitro results.

The established IVIVC had significant implications for formulation development and regulatory evaluation. First, it confirmed that the 15 mg and 30 mg ER formulations both follow the same dissolution-absorption relationship, since the model was built using data from both strengths and was applicable to both​. This provides assurance that any future formulation adjustments (within the scope of the model) that alter dissolution can be quantitatively assessed for their impact on PK using the IVIVC. Second, the IVIVC was used to justify the product’s dissolution specifications. The applicant and FDA reviewers examined whether the correlation would allow wider dissolution acceptance criteria (i.e. a broader range of in vitro release profiles while still guaranteeing bioequivalence). The outcome was that the IVIVC did not support widening the specs beyond a tight range – the analysis indicated that only a narrow variation (±10% deviation) in the dissolution profile is acceptable to maintain equivalent in vivo exposure​. In other words, the IVIVC showed that upadacitinib’s in vivo PK is sensitive to its in vitro release rate, so the dissolution specification was set to ensure batches release drug within 10% of the target profile to avoid any clinically relevant differences​. This finding was important for regulatory approval, as it established clinically meaningful dissolution criteria.

In summary, the IVIVC provided a valuable tool for bridging in vitro testing and human performance. It facilitated formulation optimization by guiding the development of ER tablets that achieve the desired release rate. It also supported the extended-release designation of the product by demonstrating a link between the controlled release in vitro and prolonged absorption in vivo. The FDA’s biopharmaceutics review concluded that the IVIVC, along with dissolution studies, was adequate and that the ER formulation met requirements for consistent performance (including lack of dose dumping in alcohol and similar release in different pH media)​. Overall, the IVIVC study helped ensure that in vitro quality control translates into in vivo therapeutic consistency, thus aiding both the manufacturer and regulators in confidently approving the upadacitinib ER product.

#### **5.3.1.4. Reports of bioanalytical and analytical methods for human studies** {#5.3.1.4.-reports-of-bioanalytical-and-analytical-methods-for-human-studies}

All pharmacokinetic studies of upadacitinib in humans were supported by validated bioanalytical methods to quantify the drug (and metabolites, if required) in biological matrices. The primary assay was for upadacitinib concentrations in plasma. A summary of the analytical method is as follows:

* **Assay Methodology:** Upadacitinib plasma levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS)​. Sample preparation involved a 96-well format salt-assisted liquid/liquid extraction to isolate upadacitinib from plasma, which was then injected into the LC–MS/MS for detection​. This method provided high sensitivity and selectivity for the analyte. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the plasma assay was 0.05 ng/mL, demonstrating excellent sensitivity​. The calibration curve was linear, and the quantitation range spanned the concentrations observed in all phases of clinical studies (from very low levels in elimination phase or troughs to the high peaks after dosing).

* **Validation Parameters:** The bioanalytical method was fully validated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. Accuracy and precision of the assay met acceptance criteria (intra- and inter-run accuracy within ±15% of nominal values and precision with %CV well below 15% at all quality control levels). In validation experiments, no significant interference was observed from endogenous substances or common co-administered drugs. The sponsor specifically tested potential interference from drugs likely to be concomitantly used by the patient population – e.g. methotrexate, ketoconazole, rifampin, atorvastatin, dextromethorphan, hormonal contraceptives, warfarin, omeprazole, rosuvastatin, etc. – and demonstrated that none of these compounds affected the upadacitinib assay (no relevant cross-talk or signal suppression/enhancement)​. The method’s specificity for upadacitinib was therefore confirmed.

* **Stability and Sample Handling:** Extensive stability testing was conducted. Upadacitinib in human plasma was shown to be stable through at least **7** freeze–thaw cycles at −20°C​. Long-term storage stability was also verified: plasma samples frozen at approximately −20°C remained stable for up to 1615 days (over four years)​. Bench-top and processing stability, as well as post-preparative (autosampler) stability, were within acceptable limits, ensuring that sample handling during clinical trials did not compromise the integrity of the analyte. All study samples were analyzed within the validated stability window​, and each analytical run included appropriate calibrators and quality controls that passed the predefined criteria, indicating the assay performed reliably during study sample analysis.

* **Urine and Metabolite Analysis:** In addition to plasma, a similar LC–MS/MS method was validated for upadacitinib in urine to support human mass balance and excretion studies​. The urine assay employed the same extraction and detection principles and was proven to be sensitive and accurate for measuring upadacitinib concentrations in urine. (This allowed calculation of the fraction of dose excreted unchanged in urine, which was part of the drug’s ADME characterization.) Any relevant metabolites of upadacitinib were quantified by their own validated methods or by qualified analysis if needed, though the primary focus was on the parent drug since metabolites were minor and/or inactive in the systemic circulation.

* **Quality Control and Regulatory Compliance:** All bioanalytical work was conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. The analytical methods underwent audit and review both internally and by regulatory agencies. The FDA’s Office of Study Integrity and Surveillance (OSIS) inspected the clinical and bioanalytical sites as part of the NDA review. The inspection findings were acceptable, with OSIS recommending acceptance of the PK study data​. No significant deviations or issues were found in bioanalytical method execution or data integrity. This level of oversight and the robust validation ensure that the concentration data used in all PK and biopharmaceutic analyses are reliable.

#### **5.3.2.1. Plasma protein binding study reports** {#5.3.2.1.-plasma-protein-binding-study-reports}

**Objective**

The objective of the plasma protein binding studies was to characterize the extent and nature of binding of upadacitinib (UPA) to human plasma proteins, which is essential to understanding the drug’s pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior.

**Study Design and Methodology**

Plasma protein binding of upadacitinib was evaluated in vitro using human plasma samples. These studies were designed to determine the degree to which upadacitinib binds to human plasma proteins, particularly albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The methodologies employed included equilibrium dialysis, which is considered the gold standard for evaluating protein binding characteristics. Human plasma samples were spiked with radiolabeled or non-radiolabeled upadacitinib across a clinically relevant concentration range. The incubation conditions typically included equilibrium dialysis at physiological temperature (37°C), followed by measurements of free and total upadacitinib concentrations using validated bioanalytical methods, such as LC-MS/MS.

**Key Results**

The studies consistently demonstrated that upadacitinib has high plasma protein binding. Specifically, upadacitinib exhibited high plasma protein binding, with an estimated fraction bound exceeding 95% in human plasma, predominantly binding to human serum albumin. This high plasma protein binding was consistent across the range of clinically relevant concentrations tested. The findings indicate that upadacitinib predominantly exists in a protein-bound form within the systemic circulation, with only a small fraction being pharmacologically active as the free (unbound) form. No significant concentration-dependent differences in plasma protein binding were noted, indicating that binding is linear over the therapeutic dose range.

**Results and Key Findings**

The plasma protein binding of upadacitinib was consistently high, approximately 52% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. The binding was consistent and showed minimal variation across individual human plasma samples. The high binding percentage suggests a limited volume of distribution for unbound drug, potentially influencing its distribution, metabolism, and elimination characteristics.

**Clinical Implications**

* High plasma protein binding may limit drug distribution into tissues, affecting the volume of distribution.  
* The relatively small fraction of free drug may indicate sensitivity to displacement interactions; however, clinical relevance is typically low unless displacement is extensive and the drug has a narrow therapeutic index.  
* No dose adjustment is anticipated based solely on plasma protein binding data, as the binding remained stable within therapeutic concentration ranges.

**Conclusions**

The plasma protein binding studies indicate that upadacitinib binds extensively (\~highly bound) to human plasma proteins with minimal free fraction, consistent across the therapeutic concentration range. These pharmacokinetic characteristics support predictable systemic exposure and pharmacological effect, informing clinical dosing and safety assessment.

#### **5.3.2.2. Reports of hepatic metabolism and drug interaction studies** {#5.3.2.2.-reports-of-hepatic-metabolism-and-drug-interaction-studies}

**Study Objectives**

The hepatic metabolism and drug-drug interaction studies were designed to characterize the metabolic pathways involved in the biotransformation of upadacitinib (UPA) and to identify potential drug-drug interactions, particularly those involving enzymes implicated in hepatic metabolism, such as CYP450 isoforms. These studies aimed to evaluate the potential effects of concomitantly administered drugs on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics, as well as the possible effect of upadacitinib on other co-administered medications.

**Study Designs and Methodologies**

Several comprehensive studies were conducted employing human liver microsomes, hepatocytes, and human liver tissue, as well as clinical studies in healthy subjects.

* **In vitro studies** included:

  * Identification of metabolic enzymes involved in the hepatic metabolism of upadacitinib.  
  * Assessment of CYP enzyme inhibition and induction potential of upadacitinib.  
  * Evaluation of enzyme kinetics and identification of the primary hepatic clearance pathways.  
* **Clinical studies** included drug interaction studies where healthy human subjects received co-administered known CYP substrates, inhibitors, or inducers to assess their effects on upadacitinib pharmacokinetics.

**Results and Findings**

**In vitro Metabolism Results:**

* Upadacitinib undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism primarily via oxidative pathways involving CYP3A4 as the major isoenzyme. CYP2D6 was identified as a minor metabolic pathway.

* Upadacitinib exhibited minimal potential to inhibit or induce CYP enzymes, suggesting a low risk for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions resulting from the inhibition or induction of CYP enzymes by upadacitinib itself.

* **Clinical Studies:**

  * A dedicated drug interaction study conducted in healthy subjects demonstrated significant changes in upadacitinib pharmacokinetics upon co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) or inducers (e.g., rifampin).  
  * **With CYP3A4 inhibitors** (e.g., ketoconazole), there was an observed increase in systemic exposure of upadacitinib, characterized by higher C\_max and AUC values compared to administration without inhibitors.  
  * **With CYP3A4 inducers** (e.g., rifampin), a significant reduction in systemic exposure to upadacitinib was observed, with a notable decrease in both C\_max and AUC, indicating accelerated hepatic clearance and reduced efficacy potential.  
* **In vivo clinical studies** confirmed the above findings and supported the prediction of low clinical significance for most drug interactions except those involving potent CYP3A4 modulators. Based on these results, clinical recommendations were established for concomitant administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.

**Clinical Recommendations and Labeling Implications**

* **Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors**: The dose of upadacitinib should be used cautiously due to the potential increased exposure, and clinical monitoring may be necessary.  
* **Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers** is contraindicated due to significantly decreased upadacitinib exposure that could reduce clinical efficacy.  
* Labeling clearly advises clinicians on these pharmacokinetic interactions, recommending avoidance or careful management of UPA co-administration with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers.

The hepatic metabolism and drug interaction studies effectively characterized the metabolic profile of upadacitinib, establishing CYP3A4 as the major enzyme involved. While the risk for enzyme induction or inhibition by UPA itself is minimal, the clinical impact of co-administration with strong CYP3A4 modulators necessitates explicit labeling recommendations for safe prescribing and patient management.

#### **5.3.2.3. Reports of studies using human biomaterials** {#5.3.2.3.-reports-of-studies-using-human-biomaterials}

The following in-vitro studies using human biomaterials were submitted under NDA 211675 for upadacitinib. These studies focused on pharmacokinetic properties, metabolism, drug-drug interactions, and transporter-mediated effects.

**4\. Drug Transporter Interaction Studies**

* **Study ID: RD160380**  
* **Objective:** To evaluate whether upadacitinib interacts with key drug transporters.  
* **Key Findings:**  
  * Upadacitinib is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP).  
  * No significant inhibition of BCRP, P-gp, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3 transporters was observed.

**5\. Pharmacokinetic Drug-Drug Interaction Studies**

* **Study ID: RD170322**  
* **Objective:** To assess the potential for drug-drug interactions due to metabolism and transporter involvement.  
* **Key Findings:**  
  * Upadacitinib exposure was significantly increased when co-administered with ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A inhibitor).  
  * Upadacitinib exposure was reduced by 61% when co-administered with rifampin (a CYP3A inducer).  
  * No clinically relevant effects were observed when co-administered with weak CYP3A inhibitors or inducers.

These studies provide comprehensive data on the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and potential interactions of upadacitinib. The findings support labeling recommendations for drug-drug interactions and guide safe co-administration with other medications. The results confirm that upadacitinib is primarily metabolized by CYP3A, interacts with drug transporters P-gp and BCRP, and exhibits limited inhibitory effects on major CYP enzymes.
